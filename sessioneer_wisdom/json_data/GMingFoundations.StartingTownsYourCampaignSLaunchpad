Keep it small, keep it flexible, and let it do the heavy lifting while you learn the ropes.\n\n> \"The simplest way to build your own campaign setting from scratch is to start with a town.\"  \n> - Matthew Colville, [Your Town | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTbD1GJUFC0)\n\n---\n## TLDR Checklist\n- [ ] Does the town fit on **one page** (map + key)?  \n- [ ] 4-6 meaningful **locations** (tavern, temple, smith, etc.)\n- [ ] 4 named **NPCs** with clear wants & quirks\n- [ ] 1 obvious **resource** the party cares about (rumours, gear, healing...)\n- [ ] 1 local **problem or hook** that points toward the wider world\n- [ ] No resident is **higher than ~5th level**\n- [ ] Nearest adventure sites are **1 day's travel** away\n\nTape this list to your screen; when every box is checked you're ready to play.\n\nHow to use it: Each time the party returns to town review the list.  If a location has been exhausted, retire or replace it; if a new NPC earned the spotlight, add them and prune an old one.\n\n---\n## 1.  Why a Town (Not a City)\n* Manageable prep - 1-2 hours is enough to know every street.  \n* Clear training wheels - players can try things without big-city consequences.  \n* Built-in limits - no raise dead, no 9th-level wizard to ask for answers.  \n* Physical hub - easy return point for downtime and quest hand-ins.\n\n> \"A city is a big sprawling place where adventure happens.  A **town** is a small, manageable chunk of content.\"  \n> - Matthew Colville\n\n---\n## 2.  Two Roads to Town\n### A.  Grab a Pre-Written Starter\nIf time is tight, steal shamelessly.\n\n| Product | Tone | Why It Works | Easy Reskin Ideas |\n|--------- | ------ | -------------- | -------------------|\n| Phandalin (D&D Starter Set) | Frontier mining hamlet | Perfect 1-page map; half a dozen quest hooks baked in | Rename water sources & swap gods   |\n| The Village of Hommlet (1979) | Classic rural grit | Detailed NPC web with hidden cult influence | Age the inn into a coach-stop motel |\n| Orlane (Against the Cult of the Reptile God) | Mystery / paranoia | Town already in trouble - players arrive mid-plot | Trade reptile cult for mind-flayers |\n| Milborne (Night Below) | Sandbox hub | Surrounded by 20+ low-level sites | Replace river barges with desert caravans |\n\n**Make it Yours in 3 Steps**  \n1. **Rename** anything that clashes with your vibe.  \n2. Swap **pantheon & laws** (e.g., declare Dragonborn illegal à la Colville).  \n3. Remove any NPC above 5th level or move them out of town.\n\n### B.  Roll Your Own in an Hour\n1. **Concept (5 min)** - fishing village, mountain pass, sky-reef...  \n2. **Map (10 min)** - 20-30 buildings; mark 6 key locations.  \n3. **Four Faces (15 min)** - Blacksmith, Priest, Tavern-keeper, Mayor.  \n   *Give each*: goal, flaw, voice hook.  \n4. **Town Trouble (10 min)** - bandits, strange dreams, disappearances.  \n5. **Resource & Price (5 min)** - what can players actually buy? what's scarce?  \n6. **Rumour Table (15 min)** - d6 snippets pointing to nearby sites.\n\nBob World Builder shows the micro-version of this in [How to Build a D&D World (the easy way)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbJu7sZkIPQ).\n\n---\n## 3.  NPC Power-Level Guidelines\n* **0-2nd** level:  commoners, guards, apprentices.  \n* **3rd-5th** level:  village veteran, hedge wizard, local priest.  \n* Anyone stronger should be **out of town** or temporarily present so the players don't wonder, *\"Why aren't they doing the quest?\"*\n\n(Same logic applies to magic items: potions yes, resurrection no.)\n\n---\n## 4.  Integrating with Your Setting\n1. **Geography** - place 3 features the town depends on (road, forest, river).  \n2. **Politics** - assign a distant authority (baron, empire) but keep them off-screen.  \n3. **Culture tweaks** - show one house rule of your setting:  \n   - Illegal Dragonborn  \n   - Two-mooned calendar  \n   - Everyone carries a knife for the nightly shadow beasts\n\nPlayers absorb setting detail effortlessly when it interferes with buying ale.\n\n---\n## 5.  Using the Town During Play\n-  **Session 1 cold-open** inside the tavern, sheriff's office, or ferry dock.  \n-  Return every 1-2 sessions to **level-up, shop, and hear news**.  \n-  Let the town **evolve**: repairs, celebrations, funerals, new buildings.  \n-  Reward investment - land deeds, titles, a renamed street.\n\n---\n### Starting in a Tavern - Colville's Slow-Burn Opener\nA well-stocked tavern can do the same heavy lifting as your whole starting town, **compressing the setting, factions, and first adventure down to a single room**.\n\n> \"A tavern is a microcosm of the world... If you start in a tavern and a fight doesn't break out, you missed an opportunity.\"  \n> - Matthew Colville, [Let's Start in a Tavern! | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPbMicg8yqM)\n\n#### Mini-Checklist (tape it next to the town one)\n- [ ] 3+ NPCs that embody the *central tension* of your campaign (law vs. chaos, empire vs. rebellion, etc.)\n- [ ] 1 proactive stir-the-pot character (bully, bounty-hunter, guild enforcer)\n- [ ] A mundane conversation starter (ordering dinner, paying for rooms)\n- [ ] Escalation trigger when table chatter slows - accusation, mistaken identity, punch thrown\n- [ ] Clear exit vector that turns the brawl into the *first quest*\n\nUse it like this: run the opening ten minutes as low-stakes colour (ordering ale, bar gossip). The moment the players seem unsure what to do next, fire your trigger scene; let the tavern erupt and watch them define their characters through reaction.\n\n#### NPC Seeds You Can Reskin in 60 Seconds\n| Role                  | Hook & Goal                                                                      | How They Might Drag PCs In |\n|----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------|\n| Flight-Captain Agent  | Enforces the Overlord's laws but secretly despises them                          | Mistakes the party for rebels or *allies them* mid-brawl |\n| Proud Outlaw Dragonborn | Wearing a hood because her race is outlawed                                    | Accused by locals; needs bodyguards to leave town           |\n| Guild Collector       | Demands the rogue PC pay dues or \"join the corpses\"                              | Sets a countdown to violence unless paid                    |\n| Bounty Hunter         | Arrives to arrest a beloved NPC; offers coin for help or threatens collateral    | Forces the party to pick a side                              |\n| Drunk Veteran         | Loudly praises the occupying army; sparks ideological argument                   | Pushes moral grey quickly                                    |\n\nSwap names, species, and uniforms to fit your setting in seconds.\n\n#### Running the Scene\n1. **Warm-up (2-3 mins)** - Serving staff recites the chalk-board menu; let each player order.  \n2. **Foreshadow (2 mins)** - Drop snippets of the campaign's tension via overheard table talk.  \n3. **Conflict Spark (improv)** - Use your trigger: mistaken identity, debt collection, illegal race revealed.  \n4. **Brawl / Debate (5-10 mins)** - Allow social rolls, intimidation, or full combat. Keep stakes local (broken furniture, bruised egos, a fleeing suspect).  \n5. **Fallout = First Hook** - Whoever \"lost\" the tavern scene tries to flee/plead, pointing the PCs toward the nearby ruin, abducted NPC, or stolen heirloom. Now you are outside the tavern and into adventure site #1.\n\n##### GM Tips\n- **Let PCs stay reactive.** Heroes emerge when their backs hit the wall, not from scripted speeches.  \n- **Watch pacing.** As soon as table energy dips, unleash the spark.  \n- **Use real consequences.** Arrest warrants, tavern damage fees, or a grateful publican create immediate stakes.  \n- **Link to your Town Map.** If the fight spills into the street, you are literally touring location #2 on your one-page town layout.\n\nIntegrate this opener once, then retire it or subvert expectations next campaign. Combined with the full town checklist above, you now have both **macro (town) and micro (tavern)** launchpads ready to fire.\n\n\nMystic Arts sums it up: *\"Play invites change.  The map and the town grow because of what happens at the table.\"*  - [Why You Should Stop Building Worlds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcun624M3Bg)\n\n---\n## 6.

That's your prep.\n\n---\n## 7.  Next Steps - From Town to Local Area\nWhen the town checklist feels automatic, it's time to pan the camera back a few hundred miles.  Matthew Colville calls this your **Local Area**-a slice of countryside roughly two weeks (≈ 300 mi / 480 km) across that can fuel months of low-level play.\n\nBelow is an adaptation of Colville's one-page *Local Area* worksheet.  Use it as soon as the party starts asking, \"So what's beyond the gate?\"\n\n### Local Area TLDR Checklist\n- [ ] Boundaries: 2-4 obvious natural edges (forest, hills, river, coastline)\n- [ ] Hub Town (the one you just built) + 2 nearby **villages**\n- [ ] 1 distant **city** on the trade-road (name only for now)\n- [ ] A **local noble** who claims the region\n- [ ] 4 cultural questions answered (What do locals think of elves? dwarves? etc.)\n- [ ] Six named **deities** (just enough for cleric domains)\n- [ ] 4 \"Local Experts\" identified (arcane, religious, historical, geographic)\n- [ ] Low-level **monster tribe** + mid-level threat in the wings\n- [ ] 1 active **Villain & Scheme**\n- [ ] 3 tiers of **secrets** (common, hidden, forgotten)\n\nTack this to the back of your screen; each tick box is a single sentence, not a lore chapter.\n\n> \"All you need is a local area and you are ready to start playing.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [The Local Area | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BqKCiJTWC0)\n\n---\n### How to Fill the Sheet (≈ 30 min)\n1. **Draw the Edges (5 min)**  \n   Lightly sketch the bounded features-forest to the west, broken hills south, a deep lake north.  Think *medieval peasant mental map*, not satellite image.\n2. **Add Settlements (5 min)**  \n   - Your starting **town** sits on a road/river.  \n   - Drop two **villages** within 1-day ride.  \n   - Name the far-off **city** the road ultimately reaches.\n3. **Place Power & Culture (5 min)**  \n   Name the baron, council, or warlord who \"owns\" the region.  Decide what ordinary folk believe about elves, dwarves, halflings, humans.\n4. **Seed Religion (5 min)**  \n   Write six god-names next to the cleric domains in the PHB.  One cool note each is plenty-for now the Sun-Grain harvest god \"Valis\" is as deep as you need.\n5. **Name Four Experts (5 min)**  \n   Arcane sage, priest, historian, pathfinder.  Level 3-7 at most.  These NPCs answer questions and hand out rumours.\n6. **Add Enemies & Villain (5 min)**  \n   Pick a nearby CR ½-1 monster tribe (goblins? kobold sky-raiders?).  Then slot in a mid-level menace farther off (ogre magi clan, green dragon, cult).  Finally draft a **villain** with a goal that will matter in session 3-6.\n\nStop.  That's a playable sandbox.\n\n---\n### Using the Local Area in Play\n- Treat the **town** as your zoom-in detail; everything else is theatre-of-the-mind until PCs visit.\n\n- **Rumours Not Maps** - medieval peasants work from stories.  Describe distance in *days* not miles.\n\n- **Promote the Experts** - when players ask *any* of the six checklist questions, point them to one of your four experts.  Instant quest hub.\n\n- **Escalate Along the Road** - each time the party levels, let trouble from the mid-level threat creep closer.\n\n- Keep a **\"Seen On the Road\"** column in your notes: livestock migrations, noble envoys, burnt wagons.  These evolve the region organically.\n\n---\n### Layering with Your Starting Town\nThe town document gives you the **micro**; this sheet gives you the **meso**.  Used together you can now:\n1.  Launch tavern hooks that point to the forest shrine 2 days out.\n2.  Have the local noble's tax-collector visit during a festival.\n3.  Reveal why the dwarves stopped selling iron to village smiths.\n\nWhen the party has explored 70-80 % of the sheet, repeat the process at the kingdom scale-or dive into a [Hex-crawl] you build the same way.\n\nFor more tips on stepping beyond the town see  \n- [Running Your First Dungeon](GMingFoundations.RunningYourFirstDungeon) - stocking nearby adventure sites  \n- [Session Zero Essentials](GMingFoundations.SessionZeroEssentials) - aligning player backstories with your local map\n\n\n---\n### Further Viewing\n- Matthew Colville - *Your Town | Running the Game*  \n- Bob World Builder - *How to Build a D&D World (the easy way)*  \n- The Fantasy Forge - *11 Tips to Create Unforgettable D&D Cities*  \n- Mystic Arts - *Why You Should Stop Building Worlds*\n\nHappy building, and remember: if it can't fit on the back of an index card, it's probably too big for level 1.\n",
