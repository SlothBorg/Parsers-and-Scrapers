Whether you're crafting a single town or an entire continent, the goal is to provide a living backdrop that inspires adventure and player engagement.\n\n## TLDR Checklist\n- [ ] Avoid information overload-build only what you need for play\n- [ ] Use a one-page campaign guide to summarize your world for players\n- [ ] Start with a small, playable region and expand as needed\n- [ ] Anchor your world in conflict, theme, or a central mystery\n- [ ] Tie nations, cultures, and religions to the world's history and geography\n- [ ] Let player actions and campaign events shape the world\n- [ ] Use familiar touchstones for improvisation and consistency\n\n- [ ] Start small: focus on a single town or region\n- [ ] Anchor the world in player experience, not encyclopedic detail\n- [ ] Prioritize playability and fun over realism\n- [ ] Use themes to make locations memorable\n- [ ] Populate with interesting NPCs and social hubs\n- [ ] Add dynamic elements (conflicts, rumors, secrets)\n- [ ] Expand organically as the campaign grows\n\n**How to use this checklist:**\nBefore each session or prep cycle, review the list. Focus on what the players will see, do, and care about. Add detail only as needed for play. Use the checklist to keep your prep focused and avoid overbuilding.\n\n---\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 0. Avoiding Worldbuilding Traps\n> \"Don't ever let these piles of world building information see the light of day... this style of world building can seem a little bit static. It can make your players feel like they lack agency.\"  \n-Stephanie Plays Games, [The Secret to ENGAGING World Building in D&D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk79Kc9EF8)\n\n- Avoid information overload-don't present a textbook to your players.\n- Don't over-prep obscure details that won't come up in play.\n- Build only what you need for the next session or adventure, and let the world grow with your campaign.\n\n---\n\n\n### 1. Start Small, Build Outward\n> \"Your world's roots should not be wide but deep. So start with a small region that takes no more than a few days to travel across. In a sufficiently dangerous world, even that small region feels infinite to the people who call it home.\"  \n-Bob World Builder, [How to Build a D&D World (the easy way)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbJu7sZkIPQ)\n\n- Start with a single town, region, or even a hex on a map. Let the world expand as needed.\n- Use familiar touchstones (favorite books, games, or movies) to inspire your world and improvise consistently.\n\n> \"All you need to build your own world for Dungeons and Dragons is a town, a local area, and an adventure. You don't need thousands of years of history, you don't need a huge globe or a continent, because your players can't get to any of those places right out of the gate.\"  \n-Matthew Colville, [Your First Town | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9capmKmysAE)\n\nBegin with a single settlement and its immediate surroundings. Let the world grow as your campaign progresses and as player choices demand.\n\n### 2. Playability Over Realism\n> \"Don't create a ton of busy work when it comes to worldbuilding... You can create more maps as players get to new areas. You can worry about the extended pantheon specifics if someone chooses to play a Paladin or a cleric.\"  \n-Stephanie Plays Games\n\n- Focus on what will actually come up in play. Don't overbuild governments, currencies, or calendars unless they matter to your story.\n- Let players help fill in details as they become relevant.\n\n> \"Striving for realism for things to make sense is not helping you. You sitting down and coming up with ways in which the city's sewage system works... is killing you and the game. All of this work just in case someone in the party asks, as if this was like a test, like they're seeing if you pass world building class, this is not leading to something that is fun to play in or fun to explore, or very importantly, too fun for you to create.\"  \n-Pointy Hat, [The EASY Way to Make D&D Cities Actually Fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCP6UvtBv0U)\n\nFocus on what's fun and actionable at the table. Only add detail that will actually come up in play.\n\n### 3. Theme and Identity\n> \"Give your world a conflict. Conflict is what creates stories. And giving your world a conflict is the easiest and most natural way to derive plot from your world.\"  \n-Pointy Hat, [The Key to World Building for D&D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zemRYitIz_k)\n\n- Pick a theme or central conflict for your world or region. This could be a war, a magical disaster, or a cultural divide.\n- Use this theme to guide the design of locations, NPCs, and adventures.\n\nA strong theme makes locations memorable. Consider the city's or region's defining feature (e.g., \"The City of Lights,\" \"The Town of Horses\"). Use this theme to guide the design of locations, NPCs, and adventures.\n\n### 4. Social Hubs and Points of Interest\n- Every settlement should have a place to gather, a source of authority, essential services, and at least one unique or fantastical element.\n- Use rumors, festivals, and local color to make these places feel alive.\n\nEvery settlement should have:\n- A place to gather (tavern, inn, plaza)\n- A source of authority (mayor, council, elder)\n- Essential services (blacksmith, healer, market)\n- At least one unique or fantastical element\n\n### 5. Dynamic Elements\n- Include rumors, conflicts, secrets, and adventure hooks to make the world feel alive.\n- Let player actions and campaign events change the world over time.\n\nInclude rumors, conflicts, and secrets to make the world feel alive. Let these elements drive adventure and player curiosity.\n\n### 6. Expand Organically\n- Add new locations, NPCs, and lore as the campaign grows. Don't over-prep-let the world develop in response to player actions.\n- Use a one-page campaign guide to summarize the main truths, themes, and hooks for your world (see Sly Flourish's method).\n\n---\n\nAdd new locations, NPCs, and lore as the campaign grows. Don't over-prep-let the world develop in response to player actions.\n\n---\n\n## Practical Frameworks\n\n- **Conflict-Driven Worldbuilding:** Start with a central conflict or threat that shapes the world (e.g., war, magical disaster, or a world-altering event). See Pointy Hat's method for examples.\n- **Touchstone Worlds:** Use 1-3 favorite fictional worlds as inspiration for consistency and improvisation (Bob World Builder).\n- **One-Page Campaign Guide:** Summarize your world's premise, tone, and key facts on a single page to keep prep focused and player-facing (Stephanie Plays Games, Sly Flourish).\n- **G.U.A.R.D.S. Method:** Government, Utilities, Architecture, Religion, Defenses, Social Hubs ([source](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/63703/city-builder-a-guide-to-designing-communities))\n- **Population-Based Design:** Scale services and complexity to the size of the settlement\n- **Theme Park Method:** Design for gameplay first-what can the players do here?

(Pointy Hat)\n\n---\n\n## Expanding Your World: Nations, Cultures, and Causality\n\n> \"You should always be asking yourself what characteristics of your world led to a certain thing to be the way that it is in your world?\"  \n-Pointy Hat, [The Key to World Building for D&D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zemRYitIz_k)\n\n- When you add nations, cultures, or races, ask how the world's history, geography, and conflicts shaped them.\n- Tie each major feature (government, magic, technology, religion) to a cause rooted in your world's central conflict or theme.\n- Use example nations or cultures to illustrate how your world is unique. (E.g., a nation ruled by academic elites after surviving a magical cataclysm, or a militaristic society shaped by constant threat.)\n- Give each culture a twist that makes it memorable and playable.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading & Resources\n- For advice on organizing your campaign's lore, prepping efficiently, and keeping your world playable, see [Lore Organization and Prep: Surviving and Thriving as a GM](WorldBuilding.LoreOrganizationAndPrep).\n\n- Pointy Hat: [The Key to World Building for D&D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zemRYitIz_k)\n- Bob World Builder: [How to Build a D&D World (the easy way)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbJu7sZkIPQ)\n- Stephanie Plays Games: [The Secret to ENGAGING World Building in D&D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk79Kc9EF8)\n- [City Builder: Designing Communities](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/63703/city-builder-a-guide-to-designing-communities)\n- [Donjon Fantasy Town Generator](https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/town)\n- [Borough Bound Cities](https://www.patreon.com/boroughbound)\n\nFor advice on dead empires and lost civilizations, see [Dead Empires and Lost Civilizations](WorldBuilding.DeadEmpiresAndLostCivilizations).\n\n- [City Builder: Designing Communities](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/63703/city-builder-a-guide-to-designing-communities)\n- [Donjon Fantasy Town Generator](https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/town)\n- [Borough Bound Cities](https://www.patreon.com/boroughbound)\n\n---\n\nFor more on building your first town, see [Towns & Cities](WorldBuilding.TownsAndCities).\nFor advice on integrating religion and pantheons, see [Religion and Pantheons](WorldBuilding.ReligionAndPantheons).\nFor advice on dead empires and lost civilizations, see [Dead Empires and Lost Civilizations](WorldBuilding.DeadEmpiresAndLostCivilizations).\n\nFor advice on integrating religion and pantheons, see [Religion and Pantheons](WorldBuilding.ReligionAndPantheons).\n",
