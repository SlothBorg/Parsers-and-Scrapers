        "content": "# 8-Step Kitbash Monster Process\nA clear, repeatable blueprint for turning two or more existing stat-blocks into an exciting *new* creature in under 15 minutes.\n\n> \"You don't need to reinvent the math-just **steal the bones** and give the monster a couple of fresh tricks.\"\n> \n> -Dadi / Mystic Arts, [8 STEPS to homebrew D&D monsters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkzvYbLyKiY)\n\n## TLDR Checklist\n- [ ] Start with a strong visual or story hook\n- [ ] Gather 2-3 parent stat-blocks (size/theme/mechanics)\n- [ ] Define the monster's role and CR target\n- [ ] Borrow core stats (AC, HP, speeds, ability scores)\n- [ ] Steal and rename a primary attack\n- [ ] Add 1-2 signature abilities (lair, reaction, AoE, etc.)\n- [ ] Insert one combat twist (reaction, phase, etc.)\n- [ ] Sanity-check the math (CR calculators/tables)\n\n**How to use this checklist:**\nWork through each step in order as you design your monster. This process keeps you focused on what matters-making a monster that is fun, surprising, and balanced for your table. Refer to the detailed sections below for examples and deeper guidance.\n\n## The Eight Steps in Detail\n\n### 1️⃣ Start with the Hook\n\"Look at the mini\" was Mystic Arts' first instruction. Whether it's a 3-D print, concept art, or a pun (\"bear-owl\"), write down *exactly what excites you*. That single line guides every later decision.\n\n> Example Hook: \"A huge owl with a bear's head that dive-bombs, grabs prey, and flies away chuckling like a grizzly.\"\n\n### 2️⃣ Collect Parent Stat-Blocks (2-3)\nOpen options that share *size*, *theme*, or *mechanics*.\nFor the Bear-Owl Dadi used:\n- Owlbear (MM, CR 3)  \n- Giant Owl (MM, CR 1/4)  \n- Brown Bear or Roper for grapple wording\n\nCopy them into a notes doc or split-screen so you can freely steal.\n\n### 3️⃣ Define Role & CR *Before* Touching Numbers\nWrite a one-sentence design goal:\n> \"A mobile CR 3 skirmisher that harasses low-level parties by snatching a back-line caster.\"\n\nIf the parents differ by more than one CR tier, pick the one closest to your target and remember you can *add or remove HP* later.\n\n### 4️⃣ Draft the Core Stats\nUse the *more interesting* parent as default, then tweak:\n\n- **Size & Hit Dice** - Use the Hit-Die by Size table below (e.g., Large ➜ d10).  \n- **AC** - split the difference between parents; round to even numbers.  \n- **Speeds** - keep at least two movement modes if fiction supports them.  \n- **Ability Scores** - grab STR / CON from the bruiser parent, DEX / WIS from the agile one, INT / CHA from whichever feels right.\n\nLightning Rule: staying within ±2 of the original numbers keeps the CR math intact.\n\n### 5️⃣ Steal a Primary Attack & Rename It\nMulti-Attack, Bite/Claw/Talon... copy verbatim, then flavour:\n\n```Snatch. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10+5) piercing, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15).```\n\n*Use published wording so you don't accidentally create loopholes.*\n\n### 6️⃣ Add 1-2 Signature Abilities\nPick abilities that instantly change player behaviour: Flyby, Pack Tactics, Regeneration, Legendary Resistance, etc. Paste them, adjust DC & recharge to taste. If you need text, plunder other editions-4e and Pathfinder have gold.\n\n### 7️⃣ Insert *One* Combat Loop Twist\nMystic Arts calls this the \"fun dial.\" Examples:\n- Reaction **Wing Buffet** that knocks people prone so the creature can escape.  \n- Recharge 5-6 **Sonic Screech** forcing CON saves vs. stun.  \n- **Molting Phase** at 50% HP that swaps damage types.\n\nOne twist is plenty at low CR; add a second only for solos or mythic tier fights.\n\n### 8️⃣ Sanity-Check & Playtest\nPlug numbers into the DMG table or an online CR calculator. If the estimate is within one step of your target, you're good. Print or screenshot the block and *run it at the table*. First combat = first playtest. Adjust on the fly, then update the document later.\n\n## Why This Works\n- Re-using published math keeps survivability in the expected band.  \n- Familiar skeleton + fresh abilities surprises veteran players.  \n- Design effort focuses on *what the monster does*, not spreadsheet minutiae.\n\n## Worked Example: The Bear-Owl (CR 3)\n\n**Bear-Owl**  \nLarge monstrosity, unaligned  \n**AC** 13 (natural armor)  \n**HP** 59 (7d10+21)  \n**Speed** 40 ft., fly 60 ft.  \n**STR** 20 (+5)  **DEX** 15 (+2)  **CON** 17 (+3)  **INT** 3 (-4)  **WIS** 12 (+1)  **CHA** 7 (-2)  \n**Skills** Perception +5, Stealth +4  \n**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 15  \n**CR** 3 (700 XP)  \n\n### Traits\n**Flyby.** The bear-owl doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.\n\n### Actions\n**Multiattack.** The bear-owl makes two Snatch attacks.\n\n**Snatch.** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8+4) piercing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the bear-owl can't Snatch another target.\n\n### Reactions\n**Wing Buffet (Recharge 5-6).** When a creature ends its turn within 5 ft. of the bear-owl, it beats its wings. Each creature within 15 ft. must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or take 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage and fall prone. The bear-owl can then fly up to half its speed.\n\n*Design Notes*: Everything except Flyby, Wing Buffet, and the grapple text came directly from the Owlbear block. The numbers were untouched, proving you don't need to juggle spreadsheets to make a monster feel brand-new.\n\n| Borrowed From | Kept | Tweaked |\n|--------------- | ------ | ---------|\n| Owlbear | STR, CON, Multi-Attack | Removed climb speed |\n| Giant Owl | 60 ft fly speed, **Flyby** trait | Higher DEX |\n| Roper | Grapple wording | Renamed to **Snatch** (talons) |\n\nAdded **Wing Attack** reaction (DC 13 CON; prone on fail) → creates a *snatch-and-drop* gameplay loop.\n\n## Designer's Toolbox\n\n### Common Pitfalls & How to Dodge Them\n1. **Over-crowding abilities.** Two cool tricks beat five forgettable ones.\n2. **Breaking action economy.** If a monster locks down PCs *and* self-buffs every round, lower its damage output.\n3. **Unclear wording.** Copy-paste official phrasing whenever possible.\n4. **Forgetting narrative hooks.** Give the creature a motive-hunting livestock, guarding ruins-so players remember more than \"that flying bear thing.\"\n\n### Tips for Smooth Kitbashing\n- Stay within one CR tier of the base block to avoid heavy recalculation.  \n- Rename damage types to fit the fiction (piercing talons vs. slashing claws).  \n- Use existing wording for conditions to avoid rules confusion.  \n- When in doubt, keep it conservative-you can always power-up mid-fight with lair actions or minion waves.\n- The first time the creature hits the table is your alpha test. Be ready to tweak HP, save DCs, or recharge rates on the fly if pacing feels off.\n\n### Quick Monster Math Reference\n\n#### Hit-Die by Size\n| Creature Size | Hit-Die Type | Avg. HP/Die | MM Example |\n|--------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------|\n| Tiny          | d4          | 2. 5         | Sprite, Imp |\n| Small         | d6          | 3. 5         | Kobold, Quasit |\n| Medium        | d8          | 4. 5         | Bandit, Zombie |\n| Large         | d10         | 5. 5         | Owlbear, Hill Giant |\n| Huge          | d12         | 6. 5         | Treant, Stone Giant |\n| Gargantuan    | d20         | 10. 5        | Kraken, Tarrasque |\n\n*Gargantuan jumps two die steps in MotM. If that feels too swingy, stay with d12 and add more hit dice.*\n\nDesign Shortcut: **Start with 8 HD** for a baseline monster, then add/subtract 2 HD per CR step you need to climb or drop.\n\n#### Proficiency Bonus by CR\n| CR Range | Proficiency Bonus |\n|---------- | ------------------|\n| 0 - 4    | +2 |\n| 5 - 8    | +3 |\n| 9 - 12   | +4 |\n| 13 - 16  | +5 |\n| 17 - 20  | +6 |\n| 21 - 24  | +7 |\n| 25 - 28  | +8 |\n| 29 - 30  | +9 |\n\nApply the PB to *all* attack rolls, save DCs (8 + PB + Ability), and skill bonuses you copy over.\n\n#### Expected AC & HP Bands\n| Intended CR | Defensive HP ≤ | Typical AC* |\n|------------- | ---------------- | --------------|\n| 1/4         | 36             | 13 |\n| 1           | 71             | 13 |\n| 3           | 116            | 13 |\n| 5           | 165            | 15 |\n| 8           | 225            | 16 |\n| 12          | 285            | 17 |\n| 16          | 345            | 17 |\n| 21          | 405            | 19 |\n| 24          | 465            | 19 |\n| 30          | 805            | 19 |\n\n*Shift AC by ±2 for every full band you overshoot/undershoot the HP benchmark to keep CR math honest.*\n\n#### Damage-Per-Round Benchmarks (Tiers 1-2)\n| Offensive CR | DPR Window |\n|-------------- | ------------|\n| 1            | 9-14 |\n| 3            | 22-27 |\n| 5            | 32-38 |\n| 8            | 55-63 |\n\nIf you raise one dial (damage, AC, or HP) beyond the window, pull a different dial back to keep the monster in the desired CR zone.\n\n#### Quick Adjustments\n| Dial | Quick Adjustment | Safe Range |\n|------ | ------------------ | -----------|\n| **HP** | Add/Subtract 15 HP per CR step | ±30 HP |\n| **Attack Bonus** | ±1 across the block | ±2 |\n| **Save DC** | 8 + PB + Ability | 12-17 (tiers 1-2) |\n| **Damage per Round** | Swap 1d6 for 1d8 | ×0. 8-1. 2 DMG table |\n\nPush two dials at once and you likely need to *pull another back* to keep CR stable.\n\n## Related Reading\n- [Action-Oriented Monsters](Combat.MonsterDesign.ActionOrientedMonsters) - upgrade solos with bonus & villain actions.  \n- [Battlefield Actions](Combat.MonsterDesign.BattlefieldActions) - add environmental stunts instead of raw damage.  \n- [Six-Ingredient Boss Recipe](Combat.BossBattles.SixIngredientBossRecipe) - scale this process up for climactic fights.\n\n## Further Inspiration\n* Pathfinder 2e Bestiary - fantastic 'grab & reskin' templates.  \n* 4e Monster Vault - clear combat roles to borrow.  \n\nGo forth, kitbash, and watch your table gasp when the *very familiar* monster does something they've never seen before!",
