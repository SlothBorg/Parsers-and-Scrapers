Synthesizes actionable advice from Ginny Di, Matt Mercer, The Fantasy Forge, MonarchsFactory, and Matthew Colville, with practical steps, warning signs, and real-world examples.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR Checklist: Burnout & Self-Care\n- [ ] Recognize the warning signs of burnout (dread, exhaustion, loss of fun)\n- [ ] Identify which GM tasks drain you most-delegate, automate, or skip them\n- [ ] Use published resources and pre-made content to reduce prep load\n- [ ] Be honest with your players about your energy and needs\n- [ ] Take breaks-short or long-before you hit a breaking point\n- [ ] Let others GM, run one-shots, or play board games to recharge\n- [ ] Adjust your campaign's scale or frequency if it's become unmanageable\n- [ ] Focus on the parts of GMing you enjoy most\n- [ ] Remember: you are a player too-your fun matters\n\n**How to use this checklist:**\nReview these points when you feel your energy dipping or dread creeping in. Use them to diagnose burnout early and take action before it ends your campaign.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Recognizing Burnout: Warning Signs\n> \"I started to feel this sense of dread before sessions... This game used to be fun, but lately I just feel exhausted when we play, like the session can't end soon enough. And then afterwards I just beat myself up about every single thing.\"  \n> -Ginny Di, [How GM burnout RUINED my campaign (and how to fix it)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJcAKJbFTPA)\n\n- Dread or anxiety before sessions\n- Exhaustion during or after play\n- Loss of excitement for prep or play\n- Feeling like GMing is a chore, not a joy\n- Taking player disengagement personally\n\nIf you notice these signs, you may be approaching burnout.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Prevention: Lighten the Load\n- **Identify what drains you:** Is it worldbuilding, encounter design, scheduling, or something else? Focus on what you enjoy and minimize the rest.\n- **Use published content:** Download maps, use pre-made adventures, or buy NPC packs. You don't have to create everything from scratch.\n- **Delegate:** Let players help with scheduling, recaps, or even running sessions.\n- **Adjust campaign scale:** If your game has grown too big, scale it back to something manageable.\n- **Prep only what excites you:** Focus on the parts of the game you love-characters, encounters, or story beats.\n\n> \"I thought the only solution to this encroaching burnout was to somehow find more time to do all that work, which is impossible. But there was a second obvious solution that I just couldn't see, which is do less work.\"  \n> -Ginny Di\n\n---\n\n## 3. Communication: Be Honest with Your Players\n- **Share your feelings early:** Let your group know if you're struggling. Most players will be supportive and may already sense something is wrong.\n- **Ask for help:** Players can take on tasks, run one-shots, or even GM for a while.\n- **Adjust expectations:** It's okay to pause, reschedule, or change the campaign's pace.\n\n> \"If I'd been honest with them earlier, I would have felt more comfortable making changes to the setting or the schedule, and they might even have been able to help.\"  \n> -Ginny Di\n\n> \"If it's getting bad, let your players know. Be honest about your worry and exhaustion and discuss amongst yourselves how to best lend to your comfort.\"  \n> -Matt Mercer, [How to Prevent RPG Game Master Burnout! (GM Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXxWmVV2aHg)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Taking Breaks: Rest is the Cure\n- **Don't push through:** Trying to \"just work harder\" only makes burnout worse.\n- **Take breaks:** Play fewer or shorter sessions, let someone else GM, or switch to board games for a while.\n- **Pause the campaign:** End on a story beat, then take weeks or months off if needed.\n- **Try something new:** Play a different system, run a one-shot, or just hang out socially.\n\n> \"The only thing that everyone agrees on when it comes to burnout is that rest is the cure. The longer you keep pushing yourself, the more rest it takes to heal.\"  \n> -Ginny Di\n\n> \"Consider if the regular schedule is just too difficult to balance among your other life commitments and perhaps roll back to a more sparse gaming routine... This will give you more time and less stress to be prepared for the next session.\"  \n> -Matt Mercer\n\n---\n\n## 5. Recovery: Returning After Burnout\n- **Be patient:** Recovery takes time. Don't rush back before you're ready.\n- **Start small:** Run a one-shot or a short arc before restarting a full campaign.\n- **Focus on fun:** Reconnect with what you love about GMing-NPCs, monsters, or player creativity.\n- **Let go of perfection:** Mistakes are normal. Your table is unique-embrace your style.\n\n> \"If running the game feels like an assignment and you're not into it, you need to come up with something you're excited by, something you can't wait to put in front of your players.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [The DM is also a Player, Running The Game #92](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-fM9UQIaLE)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Self-Compassion and Iteration\n- **You are not alone:** Most GMs experience burnout at some point. It doesn't mean you're a bad GM.\n- **Iterate your process:** Try new prep methods, pacing, or table rituals until you find what works for you. (See MonarchsFactory's [DM Anxiety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3tWiMV2UDM))\n- **Celebrate your wins:** Focus on what went well, not just what went wrong.\n- **Remember: you are a player too.** Your enjoyment matters as much as your players'.\n\n> \"If you have these feelings, if you feel this kind of DM anxiety, just seriously know that it's not a secret sign to you that you're bad at DMing. Not even close. You're gonna be fine. I believe in you.\"  \n> -MonarchsFactory, [DM Anxiety || D&D with Dael Kingsmill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3tWiMV2UDM)\n\n---\n\n## 7. Practical Tips & Table Techniques\n- **Shorten sessions or play less often if needed**\n- **Let someone else GM for a while**\n- **Use published adventures, maps, and NPCs**\n- **Delegate scheduling, recaps, or setup to players**\n- **Switch to a different game or system for a change of pace**\n- **End on a story beat before taking a break**\n- **Focus on what excites you about GMing**\n\n---\n\n## 8.
