        "content": "# Action-Oriented Monsters\n\nMaking every round matter with Matthew Colville's flagship design pattern.\n\n> \"Give them something interesting to do every round-then you can make the fight about *choices*, not hit-point math.\"\n> -Matthew Colville, *Action-Oriented Monsters* (YouTube, 2019)\n\nUse this guide when a single creature (or important lieutenant) needs to hold the table's attention against a full party.  Combine with the [Six-Ingredient Boss Recipe](Combat.BossBattles.SixIngredientBossRecipe) for set-piece encounters.\n\n***\n\n## TLDR Prep Checklist\n\n* [ ] Bonus Action every turn? (mobility, summon, buff)\n* [ ] Reaction that triggers 1-2 × per round?\n* [ ] Pre-scripted **Villain Actions** on round counts or initiative 20\n* [ ] 3-5 round life expectancy against your party's DPR\n* [ ] Counter-play obvious to observant players\n\nTape this to your screen; if any box is empty, add the missing gear before touch-ups to AC/HP.\n\n### Using the checklist\n\nDesign abilities first-worry about numbers last.  The stat table only matters once you know *what the monster does*.\n\n***\n\n## 1  Why Action-Oriented?\n\nClassic solos either crumble to focus fire or turtle behind bloated HP.  Multiple actions per round fix the action-economy gulf **without** slog.\n\nPrinciples:\n\n| Principle                 | Practical Tool                                        |\n| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |\n| Parity with Party Turns   | Bonus actions, reactions, villain actions             |\n| Show the Theme Constantly | Signature move every round                            |\n| Escalate Like a Story     | Villain actions R1 setup → R2 pressure → R3 big swing |\n| Offer Counter-Play        | PCs can interrupt, redirect, mitigate                 |\n| Keep Math Lean            | Aim for 3-5 rounds of survival; tweak HP last         |\n\n***\n\n## 2  Design Workflow (Colville Method)\n\n1. **Theme First** - One-sentence concept (\"Burrowing acid insect\").\n2. **Signature Move** - Your \"I'm special\" button used every round.\n3. **Support Moves** - 2-3 extras for variety: mobility, summon, control.\n4. **Defenses** - Mobility, damage transfer, terrain advantage.\n5. **Reaction** - Fires on PC trigger (miss, movement, spell cast).\n6. **Villain Actions** - Once per round number or on init 20.\n7. **Numbers Last** - AC, HP, to-hit set to survive 3-5 rounds.\n\n### Quick Template\n\n```txt\nACTIONS\n  Multi-Attack (bread-and-butter)\n  Signature - Recharge 5-6 / once-per-round\nBONUS ACTION\n  Minor but thematic (shift, spawn minion)\nREACTION\n  Triggered by PCs (\"On miss...\", \"When minion dies...\")\nVILLAIN ACTIONS (initiative 20 or fixed round)\n  Round 1 - Position / setup\n  Round 2 - Crowd-control / pressure\n  Round 3 - Big swing or phase shift\n```\n\n***\n\n## 3  Battlefield Actions: The Puzzle Layer\n\nFor raid-like spectacle, add **Battlefield Actions** (see Pointy Hat).  Cycle 1-2 unique mechanics: *Tell → Player Window → Pay-off*.  Keep the tell obvious and the pay-off punishing but not instant-death.\n\nExample plug-ins:\n\n| Name              | Tell                            | Counter-Play                            | Pay-off if Ignored              |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| Summoning Circles | Glyphs ignite in 3 spots        | Stand in circle, dispel, shove boss     | Spawn minions per active circle |\n| Focused Blast     | Energy orb tracks last attacker | Different PC attacks, hide behind cover | 8d6 in 20-ft cone               |\n| Petrifying Sweep  | Eye beams sweep arena lines     | Break LOS, blind boss, Flash resistance | Restrain then petrify           |\n\nUse one Battlefield Action every 2-3 rounds to avoid cognitive overload.\n\n***\n\n## 4  Worked Example: Necromancer General (CR 9)\n\n| Element      | Implementation                                                                       |\n| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Theme        | \"Life is cheap-undeath is forever.\"                                                  |\n| Signature    | *Life-Drain Siphon* (30-ft cone, heal boss)                                          |\n| Bonus        | *Redirect Pain* - damage dealt to a minion instead                                   |\n| Reaction     | *Soul Shield* - halve damage if standing on desecrated ground                        |\n| Villain R1   | Mass Raise - animate corpses as skeletal minions                                     |\n| Villain R2   | Shatter Wards - dispel all buffs within 60 ft                                        |\n| Villain R3   | Unholy Nova - DC 17 Con save, 7d8 necrotic + prone                                   |\n| Counter-Play | Convert desecrated ground with Radiant spells; destroy corpse piles to limit minions |\n\nRuns 4-rounds vs. lvl 6 party before falling or achieving objective.\n\n***\n\n## 5  Scaling Knobs\n\n* **Small Party?** Lower HP, keep actions.\n* **Large Party?** +Lieutenant or faster Villain Action cycle.\n* **High DPR?** Add reaction shield or HP-refresh phase.\n* **Low DPR?** Increase minion count so boss isn't sole target.\n\n***\n\n## 6  Testing & Table Tips\n\n* Mock combat vs. average party DPR; adjust HP.\n* If you forget to trigger an ability, cut or merge-it's cognitive overhead.\n* Declare Legendary/Villain actions loudly so players track cadence.\n* Start boss fights at session start; end with epilogue, not exhaustion.\n\n***\n\n## Further Viewing & Reading\n\n* Matthew Colville - *Action-Oriented Monsters* (YouTube)\n* Pointy Hat - *I Made a DnD Combat System & I CAN'T Play Without it* (YouTube)\n* [Six-Ingredient Boss Recipe](Combat.BossBattles.SixIngredientBossRecipe)\n* [Making Combat Fast & Fun](Combat.MakingCombatFastNFun)\n\nAction-Oriented builds turn every GM roll into a narrative beat.  Once you see your players tense up every round, you'll never go back to solitary bite-claw-claw stat-blocks.",
