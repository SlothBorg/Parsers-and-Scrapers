This document synthesizes advice from Master the Dungeon, Goblin Punch, Gundobad Games, and other top resources to help you make secret doors a highlight of your dungeons-rewarding curiosity, clever play, and player-driven investigation.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR Secret Door Design Checklist\n- [ ] Does every secret door have a *purpose* (escape, shortcut, hidden loot, lore)?\n- [ ] Are the mechanics and triggers *logical* and *thematically appropriate*?\n- [ ] Are there *multiple clues* (visual, tactile, auditory, lore) to its existence?\n- [ ] Is the secret door *optional* (not blocking critical path)?\n- [ ] Are players *rewarded for deduction* and creative investigation?\n- [ ] Is the challenge *fair*-not too obscure, not too obvious?\n\n**How to Use This Checklist:**\nUse this list when designing or placing secret doors. If you can't check most boxes, revise the door or its clues. Secret doors should be fun to discover, not frustrating or irrelevant.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Types of Secret Doors (with Examples)\n\n> \"Not all secret doors are created equal. They can appear in different locations and have wildly different mechanics and operations... The most important thing to remember is that no matter which type of door you use, they all hide a room or a passage with a specific purpose.\"  \n> -Master the Dungeon, [How to use Secret Doors Effectively in D&D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmsx-_MFQuc)\n\n- **Basic Secret Door:** Looks like a normal wall, no handle, opens by push or swing. Best in places where no one expects a door.\n- **Destructible Wall:** Single-use, breakaway wall hiding valuables or emergency passages. Nostalgic and tactile.\n- **Remote-Triggered Door:** Activated by a lever, button, or puzzle elsewhere. Can be timed for extra challenge.\n- **Concealed Opening:** Hidden by a tapestry, painting, or furniture. Players may notice drafts, sounds, or visual oddities.\n- **Illusory Wall:** Magical, walk-through, or visible only to some. Great for surprising players or rewarding experimentation.\n- **Interdiction/Magical Filter:** Only certain people or items can pass. Can be used for faction-based or story-driven secrets.\n- **Optical Illusion/Hidden in Plain Sight:** Visually identical to surroundings, e.g., a passage in a corner or a pit disguised as a floor.\n- **Classic Bookcase/Push-Button:** Trope doors with hidden triggers-pull a book, press a statue, set an item on a pedestal.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Purposeful Placement\n\n- **Every secret door should have a reason to exist.** Ask: What needs to be hidden here? Why? Who built it?\n- **Common purposes:** Escape routes, hidden vaults, secret meeting rooms, bypasses for traps, shortcuts for dungeon denizens.\n- **Never block the critical path** with a secret door unless you provide a fail-safe or alternate route.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Clues and Discovery\n\n> \"You really need to smack your players in the face with clues sometimes-make way more clues than you think you need to. Each clue you use should be a single sentence of description, a vague rumor, or a written hint.\"  \n> -Master the Dungeon\n\n### Types of Clues\n- **Visual:** Scuff marks, mismatched bricks, worn surfaces, footprints leading to a wall, glowing runes.\n- **Auditory:** Drafts, echoes, mechanical sounds, levers clicking.\n- **Tactile:** Cold air from a crack, loose stones, a statue's hand that moves.\n- **Lore-Based:** Maps with stars, journals mentioning hidden rooms, rumors from NPCs.\n\n### Example Clue Table\n| Clue Type   | Example                                 |\n|------------ | -----------------------------------------|\n| Visual     | Section of wall with mismatched bricks  |\n| Auditory   | Echoes suggesting hollow spaces         |\n| Tactile    | Cold draft from a crack                 |\n| Interactive| Movable statue hand, book, or sconce    |\n\n- **Use passive perception to hint at clues,** but require active investigation or creative play to reveal the door.\n- **Reward deduction:** Give advantage or bypass rolls if players describe clever methods or connect clues.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mechanics and Triggers\n\n- **Trigger Types:** Pressure plates, levers, hidden buttons, environmental conditions (e.g., only opens during a storm).\n- **Faction/Theme-Based Triggers:** Dwarven doors use runes, goblin doors use crude levers, etc. (see Gundobad Games).\n- **Remote or Timed Triggers:** Levers that open doors elsewhere, doors that close after a timer.\n- **Avoid overcomplication:** Keep triggers logical and discoverable.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Rewards and Outcomes\n\n- **Strategic Benefits:** Shortcuts, safe havens, bypassing traps or monsters.\n- **Tangible Rewards:** Treasure, magic items, lore, or campaign secrets.\n- **Player Agency:** Let players describe how they interact with the environment-reward creative solutions over dice rolls.\n- **Fail Forward:** If players miss a secret, let it be optional or provide a graceful failure (alternate path, rumor, or later discovery).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Common Pitfalls & Pro Tips\n\n- **Don't make secrets too obscure:** Multiple clues, logical placement, and fair mechanics.\n- **Don't hide critical content:** Never block the main story behind a secret.\n- **Don't rely solely on dice:** Reward player reasoning and engagement.\n- **Integrate with dungeon lore:** Make secret doors part of the world's history and factions.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading & Resources\n- Master the Dungeon's [How to use Secret Doors Effectively in D&D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmsx-_MFQuc)\n- Goblin Punch: [Secret Door Framework](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2013/10/secret-door-framework.html)\n- Gundobad Games: [Faction-Based Triggers](https://gundobadgames.blogspot.com/2020/07/secret-doors-in-dungeons-faction-based.html)\n- Hipsters & Dragons: [Interactive Clues](https://www.hipstersanddragons.com/secret-doors-dnd/)\n- EN World: [Best Practices for Secret Doors](https://www.enworld.org/threads/secret-doors-in-dungeons-best-practices.682264/)\n\n---\n\n**See also:**\n- [Dungeon Design](DungeonDesign)\n- [Traps](DungeonDesign.Traps)\n- [Puzzles](DungeonDesign.Puzzles)\n- [Exploration Driven Dungeons](DungeonDesign.ExplorationDrivenDungeons)\n",
