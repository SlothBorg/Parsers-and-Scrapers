        "content": "# Point Crawl\n\nA practical guide to running node-based exploration in tabletop RPGs, synthesizing best practices from The Alexandrian, Mystic Arts, and other leading GM voices.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR: Point Crawl Best Practices\n- [ ] Map key locations (points) and connect them with meaningful paths\n- [ ] Present clear, distinct choices at each point-avoid redundant or arbitrary options\n- [ ] Use clues, rumors, or visible features to guide player decisions\n- [ ] Layer discovery: allow for hidden routes, secret points, and multiple ways to find them\n- [ ] Vary travel time, hazards, and encounters based on route\n- [ ] Use pointcrawls for cities, planar travel, wilderness, or mega-dungeons-nest them as needed\n- [ ] Integrate setpiece encounters and unique events at major points\n- [ ] Let players blaze new trails with skill checks and consequences\n\n**How to Use This Checklist:**\nWhen prepping a pointcrawl, focus on what makes each location and path unique. Give players real choices, not just a map of lines. Use clues and rumors to make the world feel interconnected and alive.\n\n---\n\n## What is a Point Crawl?\nA pointcrawl is a map of key locations (points) connected by paths. Unlike a hexcrawl, which divides the world into a grid, a pointcrawl focuses on meaningful places and the routes between them. Use it for city adventures, planar journeys, wilderness with few landmarks, or any scenario where the journey is about moving between important nodes.\n\n> \"You can reduce anything to points and paths. You can do this with cities, Outer plains, big caverns, wilderness travel, mega dungeons. And it gets even better. You can use them as fractals, basically nest points within points.\"  \n-Mystic Arts, [D&D Has 5 Types of Exploration, Actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N98KzmS6y1w)\n\n---\n\n## Core Principles of Pointcrawl Design\n\n### 1. Meaningful Path Choices\n- Offer parallel routes with distinct tradeoffs (e.g., faster but dangerous vs. slower but safe)\n- Avoid redundant or arbitrary options-each path should feel like a real choice\n- Use hidden or secret routes that require investigation or skill checks to discover\n\n### 2. Location Discovery Systems\n- Provide multiple clues for each hidden location (The Alexandrian's \"Three Clue Rule\")\n- Layer discovery: automatic (visible), passive (perception checks), and active (investigation, NPCs)\n- Combine pointcrawls with hexes or dungeons for multi-scale exploration\n\n### 3. Map Creation Guidelines\n| Element               | Implementation Tips                          |\n|----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------|\n| **Known Locations**   | Minimum 3 starting points for player agency  |\n| **Connections**       | 2-3 routes between major hubs                |\n| **Travel Time**       | Use standardized intervals (e.g., watches) with pace modifiers |\n\n### 4. Encounter & Event Design\n- Trigger random encounters at set intervals or based on route\n- Place unique setpiece encounters at major points (e.g., fey market, collapsing bridge)\n- Mix environmental hazards, NPCs, and monsters for variety\n\n---\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Trailblazing Mechanics\n- Let players declare new routes between points\n- Set base travel time equal to existing comparable paths\n- Sequence: random encounter check, skill check (e.g., Survival), consequences for failure (lost, extra encounters)\n\n### Multi-Layer Crawls\n- Nest pointcrawls within hexcrawls or dungeons for fractal exploration\n- Example: Overland (hexcrawl) → Region (pointcrawl) → Dungeon (dungeoncrawl)\n\n---\n\n## Example: City Pointcrawl\n- Points: Market, Guildhall, Docks, Temple, Noble District\n- Paths: Main streets (safe, slow), alleys (fast, risky), rooftops (hidden, requires Athletics)\n- Each point offers new clues, rumors, or quests; each path has unique events or hazards\n\n---\n\n## Integrating Other GM Wisdom\n- **The Alexandrian:** Use the Three Clue Rule for hidden locations; combine pointcrawls with hexes for layered exploration ([Pointcrawls Part 2: Advanced Procedures](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/48668/roleplaying-games/pointcrawls-part-2-advanced-pointcrawl-procedures))\n- **Mystic Arts:** Nest pointcrawls for fractal design; use in cities, planar travel, or mega-dungeons ([D&D Has 5 Types of Exploration, Actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N98KzmS6y1w))\n- **Widdershins Wanderings:** Make pointcrawls player-facing-let players see the map and choose routes ([Player-Facing Pointcrawls](https://widdershinswanderings.bearblog.dev/what-makes-a-good-player-facing-pointcrawl/))\n- **Hill Cantons:** Use pointcrawls for wilderness without hexes ([Crawling Without Hexes](http://hillcantons.blogspot.com/2012/01/crawling-without-hexes-pointcrawl.html))\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading & References\n- [Exploration](Exploration) - Core principles, types, and best practices for all exploration\n- [Hexcrawls](Exploration.Hexcrawls) - For open-world, grid-based exploration\n- [Urban Exploration](Exploration.UrbanExploration) - For city-based adventures and node-based play\n- [Highlighted Interactables & Exploration Gameplay Loops](Exploration.HighlightedInteractablesNExplorationGameplayLoops) - For making each location interactive and engaging\n- [Pointcrawls Part 2: Advanced Procedures](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/48668/roleplaying-games/pointcrawls-part-2-advanced-pointcrawl-procedures)\n- [Crawling Without Hexes](http://hillcantons.blogspot.com/2012/01/crawling-without-hexes-pointcrawl.html)\n- [Player-Facing Pointcrawls](https://widdershinswanderings.bearblog.dev/what-makes-a-good-player-facing-pointcrawl/)\n- Mystic Arts' [D&D Has 5 Types of Exploration, Actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N98KzmS6y1w)\n",
