This approach, championed by Mystic Arts in [5 encounters to STEAL for your game tonight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1cQNoITtcQ), is about more than just picking cool monsters-it's about *how* they play together on the battlefield.\n\n## TLDR Checklist: Building Monster Synergy Encounters\n- [ ] Do monsters have abilities that interact or combo?\n- [ ] Is there a clear tactical puzzle for the players to solve?\n- [ ] Are there minions, lieutenants, or environmental factors that change the fight?\n- [ ] Does the encounter reward creative player tactics?\n- [ ] Can the monsters' synergy be disrupted by smart play?\n- [ ] Is the encounter's difficulty adjustable by adding/removing synergy elements?\n\n**How to use this checklist:**\nBefore running a combat, look for ways monsters can support, heal, or empower each other. Consider how the players might break these combos, and be ready to adjust on the fly for pacing and fun.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What is Monster Synergy?\nMonster synergy means designing encounters where monsters' abilities interact in ways that:\n- Make each other more dangerous or resilient\n- Create tactical challenges for the players\n- Encourage teamwork and problem-solving\n\n> \"Try making stat blocks that play together, that literally interact. Make the monsters make each other more powerful.\"  \n> -Mystic Arts, [5 encounters to STEAL for your game tonight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1cQNoITtcQ)\n\n### Why Use Synergy?\n- **Breaks up monotony**: No more slugfests where everyone just attacks the nearest enemy.\n- **Forces new tactics**: Players must adapt, prioritize, and sometimes split up.\n- **Lets GMs have fun**: You get to \"play with your toys\" and see what happens when monsters combo.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Example Synergy Combos (from Mystic Arts)\n\n### Kobold Sling Battery (Low Level)\n- **Kobolds** (with Pack Tactics) gain advantage on attacks if an ally is adjacent to the target.\n- **Kobold Dragonshield**: A tanky kobold that takes the Dodge action in melee, making it hard to hit, while back-rank kobolds pelt the party with slings at advantage.\n- **Elevated Terrain**: Place slingers on rafters or ledges, out of reach, all benefiting from the Dragonshield's proximity.\n\n**GM Tip:** Adjust the number of slingers and Dragonshields to scale difficulty. Players must find ways to break the formation or reach the backline.\n\n### Shambling Mound & Will-o'-Wisps (Tier 2)\n- **Shambling Mound**: Absorbs lightning damage to heal.\n- **Will-o'-Wisps**: Deal lightning damage, fly in and out, healing the mound while harassing players.\n- **Engulf**: The mound can restrain players, making it harder to target the wisps.\n\n**GM Tip:** Players must split focus-free allies, avoid healing the mound, and take down the wisps.\n\n### Mind Flayer & Intellect Devourers (Tier 3+)\n- **Mind Flayer**: Stuns with Mind Blast, making targets vulnerable.\n- **Intellect Devourers**: Can instantly kill stunned/incapacitated targets.\n- **Legacy Variant**: Some versions allow Intellect Devourers to attack based on Intelligence score, not just HP.\n\n**GM Tip:** This combo is deadly-warn players with foreshadowing or clues. Smart play (spreading out, counterspells) can disrupt the chain.\n\n### Mage & Shield Guardian (Tier 3-4)\n- **Mage**: Casts spells, protected by the Guardian.\n- **Shield Guardian**: Can store spells (like Fireball), use Protection to boost the mage's AC, and absorb hits.\n\n**GM Tip:** The Guardian can unleash stored spells at key moments, and its protection makes the mage much harder to take down. Players may need to separate them or disable the Guardian.\n\n### Ancient Red Dragon & Iron Golems (High Level)\n- **Iron Golems**: Absorb fire damage to heal.\n- **Red Dragon**: Breathes fire, healing the golems while damaging the party.\n- **Minions & Lieutenants**: Add kobold minions and half-dragon lieutenants for extra chaos.\n\n**GM Tip:** Players must avoid fire-based attacks, focus on the golems, or find ways to separate the dragon from its allies.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to Build Your Own Synergy Combos\n\n1. **Look for Interacting Abilities**: Healing, buffs, resistances, or effects that trigger off each other.\n2. **Mix Roles**: Combine tanks, artillery, controllers, and support monsters (see [Action-Oriented Monsters](Combat.MonsterDesign.ActionOrientedMonsters)).\n3. **Use Terrain**: Elevation, cover, or hazards can amplify synergy (e.g., unreachable slingers).\n4. **Add Disruption Points**: Give players ways to break the combo-killing the tank, disrupting spellcasting, or using the environment.\n5. **Scale Up or Down**: Adjust the number of monsters, their HP, or the environment to fit your party's level and size.\n\n> \"Once you start doing this and having these monster dynamics, either by using the Monster Manual or with your own homebrew monsters, suddenly everything starts to get a lot more fun.\"  \n> -Mystic Arts, [5 encounters to STEAL for your game tonight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1cQNoITtcQ)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Tips for Running Synergy Combos\n- **Telegraph the Combo**: Let players notice the synergy so they can plan.\n- **Reward Disruption**: If players break the combo, let it feel impactful.\n- **Stay Flexible**: Adjust on the fly if the fight is too hard or too easy.\n- **Have Fun**: These encounters are as much for the GM as the players-enjoy the chaos!\n\n---\n\n## 5.

See what happens when you bash your toys together and then you can cackle as things go insanely fun.\"  \n> -Mystic Arts, [5 encounters to STEAL for your game tonight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1cQNoITtcQ)\n\n---\n\n**See also:**\n- [Action-Oriented Monsters](Combat.MonsterDesign.ActionOrientedMonsters)\n- [8-Step Kitbash Monster Process](Combat.MonsterDesign.8StepKitbashMonsterProcess)\n- [Battlefield Actions](Combat.MonsterDesign.BattlefieldActions)\n- [Eight Core Combat Types](Combat.EncounterDesign.EightCoreCombatTypes)\n",
