They help ensure your rewards are motivating, balanced, and enhance the story.\n\n---\n\n## The Principle: Rewards Shape Behavior\n> \"The behavior a game rewards is the behavior a game encourages. If you want to know what a game is about, figure out how it rewards the player.\"  \n> - Matthew Colville, [Toward Better Rewards | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwpQwCWdhL8)\n\nRewards are not just about loot-they are a tool for shaping the kind of play you want at your table. Decide what behaviors you want to encourage (exploration, curiosity, ambition, teamwork, etc.), and design rewards that reinforce those behaviors.\n\n**Classic vs. Modern D&D Rewards:**\n- In classic D&D, players were motivated by gold and magic items, which were the main way to level up (1 XP per gold piece found). This encouraged proactive, curious, and ambitious play-players explored, took risks, and were rewarded for it.\n- In modern D&D (4e/5e), gold is often meaningless and magic items are rare. Most rewards come from leveling up, which is often tied to simply showing up and playing, not to player-driven goals or curiosity. This can lead to more passive play, where players expect the DM to provide all motivation.\n\n> \"If you want to know what a game is about, figure out how it rewards the player. Classic D&D rewarded curiosity and risk-taking. Modern D&D often rewards just showing up.\"  \n> - Matthew Colville, [Toward Better Rewards | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwpQwCWdhL8)\n\n**Actionable Advice:**\n- If you want more engaged, proactive players, make sure your rewards encourage the behaviors you want to see. If you want curiosity, reward it. If you want ambition, reward it. If you want teamwork, reward it.\n- Explicitly tie rewards to player-driven goals, not just to completing the DM's story.\n\n---\n\n## Types of Quest Rewards\n\n### 1. Gold & Treasure\n- Classic, but can become meaningless if players have nothing to spend it on\n- Make gold useful by providing opportunities to spend it: property, custom gear, information, or world-changing investments\n- Avoid giving gold for its own sake-tie it to story or player goals\n- Ensure the amount is commensurate with the difficulty of the quest[3]\n\n### 2. Magic Items & Equipment\n- Magic items should be rare, memorable, and tailored to the party or quest\n- Use single-use or limited-use items to avoid power creep (e.g., chime of opening, potions with limited doses)\n- \"The weirder the better\"-unique items encourage creative play  \n- Make your rewards system flexible so players can sell unwanted items for a decent price[3]\n> \"The more specific the item, the less likely it will seriously skew your game balance, and the more likely it'll actually be fun and narratively interesting.\"  \n> - Ginny Di, [How to make D&D loot matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omLcTk6FYYo)\n\n### 3. Experience Points & Leveling\n- XP can be tied to specific achievements, not just combat[3]\n- Consider milestone leveling for major quest completions\n- Make the link between goal and reward explicit (e.g., \"Escort the villagers to safety: Level up\")\n\n### 4. Narrative & Social Rewards\n- Titles, land, letters of recommendation, or special favors from powerful NPCs[1][3]\n- New allies, access to exclusive locations, or the gratitude of a community\n- Status, rank, rights, privileges, and property[1]\n- These rewards can open new storylines or provide future advantages\n\n### 5. Abilities, Skills, & Boons\n- Temporary or permanent buffs, new skills, or unique abilities[2]\n- Specialized training resulting in feats or new techniques (taking 1-2 days of downtime)[1]\n- Permanent bonuses based on character experiences (like resistance to specific attack forms)[2]\n- Use sparingly for major achievements or personal quests\n- Draw inspiration from the DMG's \"blessings,\" \"charms,\" and \"epic boons\"\n\n### 6. Information & Story Progression\n- Clues, secrets, or lore that advance the plot or reveal new opportunities\n- Access to new areas, factions, or resources\n\n### 7. Renown & Reputation\n- Increasing or decreasing reputation with in-game factions[3]\n- Earning titles such as \"the Brave\" or \"Master Locksmith\"[3]\n- Can cause NPCs to mention the character in dialog or grant discounts[3]\n\n### 8. Patrons, Mentors & Allies\n- Influential NPCs who can obtain things money can't buy[1]\n- Organizations that offer resources and backing\n- Companions or followers who join the party[4]\n\n---\n\n## Goal-Oriented Rewards: The Card Method\nMatthew Colville recommends using physical cards or handouts to make goals and rewards explicit:\n\n### How to Use the Card Method\n- Write the goal on one side, the reward on the other. Example: \"Goal: Visit the Temple of Akamitsu. Reward: Gain a blessing (mechanical or narrative boon).\"\n- Listen for player ideas and ambitions-when a player expresses a goal (\"I should check out that temple\"), turn it into a card and present it to them. This makes the goal and reward explicit and motivating.\n- Goals can be:\n  - Personal (resolve a backstory conflict, find a lost relative)\n  - Party-wide (escort villagers to safety, defeat a villain)\n  - Secret (known only to one player)\n  - Public (shared by the group)\n  - Optional or time-limited (\"Do this before the festival ends\")\n  - Expiring (if not completed in time, the opportunity is lost)\n- Rewards can be anything: XP, magic items, new skills, narrative boons, temporary or permanent buffs, social status, information, or even just a cool story moment.\n- Break big goals into smaller, level-appropriate steps. For example, \"Learn the deep secrets of the world\" becomes a series of smaller, local goals, each with its own reward.\n- Different PCs can have the same goal but different rewards, tailored to their motivations.\n\n#### Example: Implementing the Card Method\n- Player says: \"I should go check out the temple to Akamitsu.\" (from Colville's Chain of Acheron campaign)\n- DM immediately creates a card:\n  - Goal: Visit the Temple of Akamitsu.\n  - Reward: Gain a blessing from the temple (could be a mechanical boon, narrative advantage, or a new contact).\n- When the player completes the goal, they receive the reward-immediately and explicitly. This transforms a passing player comment into a concrete, motivating objective.\n\nAnother example from the video:\n- Party is tasked with escorting villagers to safety during a crisis.\n- DM creates a group card:\n  - Goal: Get the villagers safely out of the We.\n  - Reward: Level up (explicitly tying advancement to a clear, story-driven objective).\n- The party knows exactly what they need to do and what they will gain, increasing motivation and focus.\n\nPersonal/psychological example:\n- Player has a backstory conflict with their father.\n- DM creates a card:\n  - Goal: Resolve the conflict with your father.\n  - Reward: Gain inspiration, a permanent bonus to Wisdom saves, or a new social connection.\n- This makes personal story arcs actionable and rewarding, not just flavor.\n\nExpiring/time-limited example:\n- Player hears about a rare festival happening in three days.\n- DM creates a card:\n  - Goal: Win the archery contest at the festival (must be completed before the festival ends).\n  - Reward: Receive a magical quiver and the respect of the local hunters' guild.\n- If the player misses the window, the opportunity (and reward) is lost, adding urgency and stakes.\n\n> \"Just telling the player they will get a reward if they do something can drastically change their behavior. It can take something they thought about that they assumed would happen if they just kept playing long enough, and turn it into something the player wants to make happen.\"  \n> - Matthew Colville, [Toward Better Rewards | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwpQwCWdhL8)\n\n**Tips:**\n- Start small-don't overload players with too many goals at once. Let them accumulate more over time as they play and complete objectives.\n- Use the card method to encourage the specific behaviors you want to see at your table, whether that's exploration, roleplay, teamwork, or personal story arcs.\n- You don't have to use physical cards-any clear, explicit method works.\n\n> \"The power of this idea is that you can reward whatever behavior you want to see. If you think your players aren't motivated, curious, or ambitious, you can use this to encourage that behavior. Even more powerful, you can create goals and rewards based on what the players want to do.\"  \n> - Matthew Colville, [Toward Better Rewards | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwpQwCWdhL8)\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices for Rewarding Players\n- **Listen for Player Goals:** Turn player ideas and ambitions into explicit goals with clear rewards. If a player mentions a personal goal or backstory element, make it actionable and rewardable.\n- **Vary Reward Types:** Mix gold, items, narrative, and mechanical rewards to keep things fresh. Consider psychological or social rewards (e.g., resolving a family conflict, gaining a new ally).\n- **Tie Rewards to Behavior:** Reward curiosity, ambition, and proactive play-not just combat. If you want players to explore, reward exploration. If you want them to roleplay, reward roleplay.\n- **Scale Appropriately:** Match the reward to the challenge and player's level. Break big goals into smaller, achievable steps with appropriate rewards.\n- **Let Players Choose:** When players choose their rewards, they'll value them more. Offer options or let them express preferences.\n- **Avoid Overload:** Too many rewards can dilute their impact and become a chore. Start with a few clear goals and add more as needed.\n- **Make Rewards Meaningful:** Ensure rewards are useful enough to feel significant. Avoid giving out gold or items that have no impact on play.\n- **Don't Upset Balance:** Avoid random powerful rewards that bypass progression. Use unique, flavorful rewards that fit the story and characters.\n- **Make Rewards Part of the Story:** Integrate rewards into the narrative, not just as a transaction. Rewards can open new storylines, create complications, or tie into future adventures.\n- **Use Consequences:** Occasionally, rewards can come with strings attached (e.g., a magic item with a curse, or a title that brings new responsibilities).\n- **Encourage Proactive Play:** The more rewards are tied to player-driven goals and actions, the more engaged and motivated your players will be. Passive play is often a result of unclear or unmotivating rewards.\n\n> \"In classic D&D, players who weren't motivated, curious, proactive, ambitious, got fewer rewards. If you didn't show up one night, you got no rewards, no xp, no magic, and as a result, you leveled up more slowly.\"  \n> - Matthew Colville, [Toward Better Rewards | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwpQwCWdhL8)\n\n---\n\n## Example Reward Structures\n\n- **Classic Dungeon Crawl:** Gold, magic items, and XP for exploration and overcoming dangers\n- **Political Intrigue:** Favors, information, and social standing as rewards for clever play\n- **Personal Quests:** Unique abilities, narrative boons, or custom items tied to a character's backstory\n- **Sandbox Campaign:** Access to new locations, resources, or allies as the party shapes the world\n\n---\n\n## References & Further Reading\n- Matthew Colville, [Toward Better Rewards | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwpQwCWdhL8)\n- Matthew Mercer, [Rewarding Your Players!
