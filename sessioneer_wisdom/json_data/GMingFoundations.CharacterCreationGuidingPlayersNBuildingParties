        "content": "# Character Creation: Guiding Players & Building Parties\n\nHelping players build their first heroes is often the very first *GM job* after Session Zero.  Use the guidance below to keep the process clear, fair - and, most of all, exciting.\n\n---\n## TL;DR Checklist\n- [ ] Explain the **six abilities** & how the *modifier* is the number that actually matters\n- [ ] Agree on **one ability-score generation method** (or offer 2 clear choices)\n- [ ] Tell players *why* each method exists: fairness vs. drama vs. speed\n- [ ] Clarify **proficiency bonus** early (\"things you're trained in get +2 at 1st level\")\n- [ ] Remind the table a *balanced party is optional* - fun concepts first\n- [ ] Preview campaign tone so players can build toward a **shared party concept**\n- [ ] Keep safety nets handy (NPC healer, extra potions, quick backup character sheet)\n\nUse this list during Session Zero; check off each item as soon as the group is comfortable.\n\n---\n## 1. Teaching Ability Scores & Modifiers\nNew players often stumble over \"two numbers per stat.\"  Try this script:\n> \"We roll **6 numbers between 3-18**.  Then we translate each to a **modifier** between -4 and +4.  *That* second number is what we'll add to most rolls.\"\n\nMatthew Colville stresses that transparency:  \n> \"Once you've generated those six numbers, you look each one up on a table ... from then on, you use the modifier.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, *Making Characters* ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K9mKpAMREU))\n\nTip: Put a copy of the modifier table in the middle of the table or tape it to the VTT.\n\n---\n## 2. Picking an Ability-Score Method\n| Method | Why GMs Pick It | Player Experience |\n|-------- | ----------------- | -------------------|\n| **4d6 drop lowest, arrange to taste** | Classic excitement; heroic averages | High agency, swingy results |\n| **Standard Array (15,14,13,12,10,8)** | Perfect equity at the table; fast | No surprises, slightly bland |\n| **Point-Buy** | Fine-tune concepts; allows min-max play | Mathy but fair |\n| **\"In-Order\" Random** (4d6 in order) | Character discovery; kills analysis-paralysis | Forces creative concepts |\n| **Hybrid / House Rule** | Custom fits campaign tone | Explain clearly! |\n\nBob World Builder reminds us why 4d6 drop-lowest stays popular:  \n> \"It gives you high-ish numbers without rolling a ton of times *and* the flexibility to be who you want.\"  \n> -Bob World Builder, *Roll Your Stats Like Gygax* ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeVkyI8rlOQ))\n\n### Colville's \"Heroic Discovery\" House Rule\n1. Roll **4d6 drop lowest in order** (Str first, Dex second...)\n2. If the final array has **fewer than two 15s**, scrap it and roll again.\n3. Play the stats where they fall - discover who the character *is*.\n\nGM Use-Case: perfect for tables of brand-new players who have no strong class preference.\n\n---\n## 3. De-Bunking the \"Balanced Party\" Myth\nA cleric, rogue, wizard, and fighter is *one* way to play - not the only way.\n\n> \"I challenge the notion that you need a balanced party... Some of the most memorable things I've experienced were when we threw those expectations out.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, *Making Characters*\n\nStrategies when roles are missing:\n* **Lean on NPC support** - hirelings, a temple willing to trade potions for favours, a mercenary tank who asks 10 gp/day.\n* **Alter encounter design** - fewer traps if there's no rogue, optional social solutions if no face.\n* **Give thematic magic items** - e.g., *Healing Salves* in a no-cleric game.\n\nEncourage themed parties: *all adepts from the same monastery*, *a conclave of novice wizards*, or *condemned criminals offered one chance at freedom*.\n\nCross-reference: see [Session Zero Essentials](GMingFoundations.SessionZeroEssentials) for structuring this discussion.\n\n---\n## 4. Clearing Up the Proficiency Bonus\nPlayers often ask \"Where does this +2 come from?\"  Offer a one-sentence hook:\n> \"If your background or class trained you, add +2 - that number will grow as you level.\"\n\nThen move on.  Don't deep-dive into the maths unless someone is curious.\n\n---\n## 5. Tools & Shortcuts for New Players\n- Share a **fillable spreadsheet** (Colville recommends *Forged Anvil* for D&D 5e).  \n- Pre-calculated **class starter kits**: armour class already filled, typical weapons & gear.  \n- A printed **\"cheat margin\"** on character sheets:  How to roll an attack, a save, a skill.\n\n---\n## 6. Safety Nets & Backup Plans\nEven with heroic arrays, some players will roll poorly or the party may lack a key role.\n\n1. **NPC Sidekicks** (Tasha's Cauldron) scale neatly.  \n2. **Potions for Quests** - local temple grants 2d4 *Potions of Healing* if the party accepts a hook.  \n3. **Fast Replacement Characters** - keep a blank sheet & a copy of your chosen stat method ready.\n\n---\n## 7. Session Zero Prompts\nAsk each player:\n1. Which ability-score method excites you?  Why?\n2. Are you happy filling a traditional role or chasing a wild concept?\n3. Would you enjoy a shared back-story or prefer to meet in the tavern?\n\nRecord answers and build your prep around them.\n\n---\n### Quick Reference\n- Ability score = heritage & training, **modifier = gameplay**  \n- Choose a generation system that matches *campaign tone* (grim? heroic? gritty?)  \n- A party can survive without any one role - the GM's world can flex.\n\n> \"Rolling dice is fun, discovering who you've rolled is *magic*.\"  -Paraphrased table wisdom\n\nHappy character building!\n\n---\n\n## For Advanced GMing & Meta-Level Advice\nFor advice on managing expectations, avoiding burnout, and meta-level skills for veteran GMs, see [Advanced GMing & Meta-Level Advice](GMingFoundations.AdvancedGmingNMetaLevelAdvice).\n",
