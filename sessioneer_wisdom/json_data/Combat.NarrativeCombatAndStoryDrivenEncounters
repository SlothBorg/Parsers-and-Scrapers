Synthesizing advice from Dael Kingsmill (MonarchsFactory), Matthew Colville, Mystic Arts, and more.\n\n---\n## TLDR Checklist: Narrative Combat Prep\n- [ ] What are the **stakes** of this encounter? (Death, injury, resource tax, or just a memorable moment?)\n- [ ] Where does this fight fit in the **story arc**? (Climax, filler, rising action, etc.)\n- [ ] What **feeling** do you want the players to have? (Desperation, triumph, tension, relief)\n- [ ] Are the **stakes visible** to the players, or are you using techniques to *force perspective*?\n- [ ] Have you planned at least one **signature moment** for the encounter?\n- [ ] Is the **timing** of signature moments and stakes appropriate for the session and campaign?\n- [ ] Are you prepared to follow through on the consequences of the stakes?\n\n**How to use this checklist:**\nBefore prepping a combat, run through these questions. Adjust your encounter design, monster actions, and narrative beats to match the answers. Use the rest of this guide for techniques and examples.\n\n---\n## 1. Stakes: The Heart of Narrative Combat\n\n> \"A combat encounter for narrative purposes, serving narrative purposes, is all about stakes. You need to decide what the stakes are for this particular combat encounter. And you need to ride with those stakes. You need to let those stakes stand.\"  \n> - Dael Kingsmill, [Combat that Serves the Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHPvBrA_j2Q)\n\n- **High Stakes:** Death, major injury, or world-altering consequences. Use sparingly-only when you're willing to follow through.\n- **Medium Stakes:** Lasting injuries, loss of resources, or the death of a single party member. Consider narrative appropriateness (e.g., avoid mid-campaign deaths unless it fits the story).\n- **Low Stakes:** Resource tax, blowing off steam, or a memorable but non-lethal challenge. Not every fight needs to be deadly or even memorable.\n\n**Tip:** The *feeling* of high stakes can be created even when the real risk is low, using techniques like wave combat, action economy tricks, and signature moments.\n\n---\n## 2. Context: Where Does This Fight Fit?\n- **Story Arc Placement:** Is this the climax, a rising action, or a filler scene? High stakes fit best at climaxes; low stakes are fine for filler.\n- **Session Timing:** Deadly fights at the start of a session can feel off; consider pacing and what you want players to remember.\n- **Narrative Rightness:** Avoid introducing new PCs or resurrecting characters right before the campaign's end-save the biggest consequences for the finale.\n\n---\n## 3. Techniques for Shaping Narrative Combat\n\n### a. Force Perspective (Illusion of Danger)\n- Use *wave combat* (e.g., send 4-5 enemies at a time, not all 20 at once) to create the feeling of being outnumbered without overwhelming the party.\n- Cheat your angles like stage magic: describe more enemies than are mechanically present.\n- Target the right PCs with big moves (e.g., hit the barbarian with the heavy attack to show danger, but keep them safe).\n\n### b. Signature Moments\n- Plan 1-3 memorable, cinematic actions for the villain or monster (e.g., a ghost possesses a PC and forces them to leap from a parapet).\n- Time these moments for maximum narrative impact-late in the fight for drama, not too early to avoid undercutting tension.\n- Signature moments don't have to be deadly: a spellcaster casting darkness on a helmet and throwing it into the fray can be just as memorable.\n\n> \"I give the bad guy or one of the bad guys a signature moment, by which I mean this is the thing that I want the players to remember later when they look back at the fight.\"  \n> - Dael Kingsmill, [Combat that Serves the Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHPvBrA_j2Q)\n\n### c. Injury and Consequence Systems\n- Use injury systems (e.g., major injury on taking half HP in one blow) to create drama without instant death.\n- Let injured PCs struggle through the end of the fight for cinematic moments (\"I'm fine... we won the battle... oh, I'm bleeding...\").\n\n### d. Timing and Pacing\n- Decide how many rounds you want the fight to last. Short = low stakes, long = epic.\n- Match the number of signature moments and the pacing to the desired stakes.\n- Place signature moments late in the fight for maximum impact.\n\n---\n## 4. Avoiding Narrative Pitfalls\n- **Death Yo-Yos:** Avoid repeated knockdowns and instant revives-they sap drama. If a PC falls, let the story focus on them for a moment.\n- **Stolen Vibes:** Triggering big moments too early or too late can rob them of impact. Time them for the middle or end of the fight.\n- **Overusing High Stakes:** Save true lethality for the campaign's climax or when it fits the story's needs.\n\n---\n## 5. Examples & Case Studies\n- **Redcaps Wave Combat:** Dael Kingsmill describes using waves of redcaps to create the feeling of being surrounded, but only ever putting a few on the field at once. The players felt threatened, but the real risk was low.\n- **Signature Move Timing:** A ghost's possession move is saved for round 4 or 5, so the drama lands just before the fight ends, not too early to be undercut by healing.\n- **Resource Tax Fights:** Sewer rats as a resource drain before a big boss-players don't need to remember every fight, but the pacing matters.\n\n---\n## 6.

Final Thoughts\n\n> \"D&D isn't the game that you play at the table with the dice, it's your friends chatting about it afterwards and remembering the story of what their characters did.\"  \n> - Dael Kingsmill, [Combat that Serves the Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHPvBrA_j2Q)\n\nNarrative combat is about creating stories your players will tell long after the session ends. Use stakes, timing, and signature moments to make every fight matter-whether it's deadly or just a memorable scene.",
