For each leg, decide the distance, pick the number and type of events, and ensure each event is meaningful. Adjust on the fly for pacing or player engagement. If travel doesn't serve the story, feel free to skip it-see the \"Permission to Skip\" section below.\n\n---\n\n## Why Traditional Travel Fails\n> \"The problem that people have with D&D travel isn't that it isn't realistic, it's that it's boring and bad to play.\"  \n> -Pointy Hat, [Traveling in D&D is Bad (and how to Fix It)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM18P0WKGFA)\n\n- **Overly granular systems** (tracking miles, rations, etc.) bog down play and rarely add fun.\n- **Random encounter tables** often produce disconnected, meaningless events that don't advance story or character.\n- **Travel as filler**: If nothing meaningful happens, skip it! (Matt Colville, Ginny Di)\n\n---\n\n## Permission to Skip Travel (Matthew Colville)\n> \"If travel doesn't advance the plot, I am giving you permission to just skip it. Narrate it in such a way that makes it sound real... I've never regretted fast forwarding past the just getting from point A to point B part. I have often regretted trying to make it interesting.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Making Travel Interesting | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvQ2JgZIjVI)\n\nUnless travel is meant to be dangerous, character-building, or plot-relevant, you can simply narrate the journey and move on. Don't feel pressured to make every trip an event-save your prep and table time for the moments that matter.\n\n---\n\n## The Pointy Hat Travel Event System (TES)\nA narrative-first, event-based approach to travel:\n\n### 1. Abstract Distance\n- **Close:** 1 event\n- **Far:** 2 events\n- **Very Far:** 3 events\n- *Adjust as needed for pacing or drama.*\n\n### 2. Curate Events (Not Random Tables)\n- **Red (Combat):** A tailored, story-relevant fight (not just wolves!).\n- **Yellow/Green (Exploration):** Environmental challenge, skill challenge, or discovery.\n- **Blue (Roleplay):** Social encounter, moral dilemma, or character moment.\n- *Mix and match for hybrid events (e.g., a roleplay encounter that turns into combat).* \n\n#### Using the 5 Room Dungeon for Travel\nTrekiros, in [Steal my Dungeon (it's a... travel encounter?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF1vX9hs9Jc), demonstrates how the 5 Room Dungeon structure can be repurposed for travel sequences:\n\n- **Entrance/Guardian:** Start with a hook or immediate challenge (e.g., rescuing NPCs on the road).\n- **Roleplay Challenge:** Social or investigative scene (e.g., traveling with rescued NPCs, building attachment).\n- **Setback/Exploration:** Environmental or situational complication (e.g., a hidden threat at a roadside inn).\n- **Climax/Boss:** Major confrontation (e.g., a boss monster ambushes the party at their most vulnerable).\n- **Reward/Revelation:** Payoff that ties into the next adventure (e.g., clues, loot, or a choice that impacts the story).\n\n> \"If you squint hard enough, everything is a dungeon. This fantasy city, it has a bunch of rooms, but we call them houses instead... If you know techniques to help you build interesting dungeons, you can use those techniques even if what you're preparing isn't a dungeon.\"  \n> -Trekiros, [Steal my Dungeon (it's a... travel encounter?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF1vX9hs9Jc)\n\n**Why use this?**\n- Ensures variety and pacing in travel encounters\n- Gives every player a spotlight moment (combat, roleplay, exploration)\n- Creates a cohesive, story-driven travel sequence\n\n#### Example: The Snoring Dragon Inn (Trekiros)\n- **Entrance:** Rescue a family of halflings from giant wasps\n- **Roleplay:** Travel with the halflings, build rapport\n- **Setback:** Arrive at a mysterious inn run by a disguised monster\n- **Climax:** Boss fight when the party is most vulnerable\n- **Reward:** Magic items, plot hooks, and a choice-rest or pursue the villain immediately\n\nThis approach can be used for any travel segment, not just dungeons. See [5 Room Dungeon Design](DungeonDesign.5RoomDungeonDesign) for more.\n\n### 3. Make Every Event Matter\n- Tie each event to the world, the party's goals, or ongoing storylines.\n- Use events to introduce lore, foreshadow future threats, or develop characters.\n- Let players' choices in one event affect later events or outcomes.\n\n### 4. Flexible & Player-Focused\n- Adjust the number and type of events to fit your group's pacing and interests.\n- If players want to move quickly, reduce events; if they want more adventure, add events.\n- Let players suggest or choose event types for more agency.\n\n> \"You can make a close distance take two events instead of just one. A far one take three. A very far one take four. Or more or less. If the players feel like they're taking too long and they would rather get to the place, you can take away events.\"  \n> -Pointy Hat\n\n---\n\n## Using Skill Challenges for Travel (Matthew Colville)\nSkill challenges are a powerful way to make travel engaging when you want the whole party to contribute and the journey itself is meant to be tense or meaningful.\n\n> \"If you want to give travel tension... a great way to do that is a skill challenge from 4th edition... The players tell you what skills they're going to use and how they're going to use them. They have to narrate or justify their use of the skill.\"\n> -Matthew Colville, [Making Travel Interesting | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvQ2JgZIjVI)\n\n### How to Run a Travel Skill Challenge\n1. **State the Goal:** The party will reach their destination, but the number of failures determines what happens along the way.\n2. **Set Success/Failure Thresholds:** E.g., 4 successes before 3 failures. (See [Skill Challenges](GameMechanics.ChallengeDesign.SkillChallenges) for more.)\n3. **Let Players Justify Skills:** Players describe how their skills help the journey. Require proficiency or a strong narrative fit.\n4. **No Repeats:** Each player can only use a given skill once.\n5. **Vary DCs:** Some skills are more relevant than others-adjust DCs accordingly.\n6. **Narrate Outcomes:** Fewer failures = smooth travel; more failures = tougher encounter, lost resources, or a roleplay/puzzle complication.\n\n#### Example: Travel Skill Challenge Outcomes\n- **0 failures:** The party arrives safely, no encounter.\n- **1 failure:** A minor obstacle or a simple encounter (e.g., a negotiation with suspicious elves).\n- **2 failures:** A moderate challenge (e.g., a tough combat, a tricky puzzle, or a tense social scene).\n- **3 failures:** A major complication-dangerous combat, lost time, or a significant setback at the destination.\n\n> \"It doesn't automatically have to be a combat that they deal with. Maybe they encounter a bunch of elves who question them... maybe it's a puzzle... there should be one framework, the skill challenge for getting from point A to point B.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville\n\nFor a full breakdown and more templates, see [Skill Challenges](GameMechanics.ChallengeDesign.SkillChallenges).\n\n---\n\n## Example: TES in Action\n- **Journey: Far (2 events)**\n    - **Event 1 (Exploration):** Crossing a haunted bridge-skill challenge to avoid spirits.\n    - **Event 2 (Roleplay/Combat):** Meet a rival adventuring party; negotiation could turn to combat if things go south.\n- **Arrival:** The party reaches their destination, changed by the journey.\n\n---\n\n## Integrating Other GM Wisdom\n- **Ginny Di:** Make travel its own quest-tie events to plot, NPCs, and choices. Avoid filler.\n- **Matthew Colville:** If travel doesn't advance the story, skip it. If it does, use skill challenges for group problem-solving.\n- **Mystic Arts:** Use hex-crawls for discovery-driven exploration, but ensure choices are informed and events are meaningful.\n- **Bob World Builder:** Seed plot hooks and lore in travel events; let players help design encounters for more buy-in.\n\n---\n\n## When to Use TES (and When to Skip Travel)\n- Use TES when travel is meant to be adventurous, dangerous, or character-building.\n- Skip or montage travel when nothing meaningful is likely to happen.\n- Always ask: \"Will this journey create memorable moments or just delay the story?\"\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading & References\n- Pointy Hat's [Traveling in D&D is Bad (and how to Fix It)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM18P0WKGFA)\n- Ginny Di's [Why travel in D&D sucks (and 3 steps to fix it)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5qGZNmCr9U)\n- Matthew Colville's [Making Travel Interesting | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvQ2JgZIjVI)\n- Mystic Arts' [Why 3-mile hexes make HEXCRAWLS fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEIg1DlRkLg)\n- Bob World Builder's [Rethink D&D Exploration with 1 House Rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwf2YNxmOF8)\n\n---\n\n**See also:** [Skill Challenges](GameMechanics.ChallengeDesign.SkillChallenges), [Random Encounters](GameMechanics.ChallengeDesign.RandomEncounters), [Hexcrawls](GameMechanics.Exploration.Hexcrawls)",
