It distills Matthew Colville's Delian Tomb episode alongside quick pointers from Bob World Builder and The Fantasy Forge.\n\n> \"Every encounter should give the goblins a chance to yell for help.  The first time that happens your players will freak out.\"  \n> - Matthew Colville, [Running Your First Dungeon | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvQXGs8IVBM)\n\nSee also: [Running Your First Game](GMingFoundations.RunningYourFirstGame) for pre-session logistics and checklists.\n\n---\n## TLDR Dungeon Loop\nPrint this card, keep it next to your initiative tracker.\n\n1. Establish *stakes* (Why here? What's the clock?)  \n2. Ask for the **approach roll** (Stealth, Perception, or both)  \n3. Determine **surprise** & set starting distance  \n4. Call **initiative** → run 3-round micro-story  \n5. At end of round 1, **check enemy morale** (retreat? yell?)  \n6. Describe lingering **sensory details** (smell, sound)  \n7. Offer **choice, rest, or onward**  \n   - If party lingers, roll random encounter (d6 → 1)  \n8. Loop until boss / treasure / exit.\n\nTick through these eight beats and your first crawl will feel intentional-not a random string of rooms.\n\nHow to use: glance at the loop any time you feel the pace wobble.\n\n---\n## 1.  Start Outside - Patrols Create Tension\nColville's tomb places a **2-goblin patrol** that circles the exterior every 10 minutes.\n\n-  **If spotted first:** players decide between ambush or evasion.  \n-  **If patrol spots PCs:** one goblin flees, guaranteeing a harder next room.  \n-  **If neither notices:** ships-in-the-night; the patrol just passes.\n\nActionable table (add patrols to *any* beginner map):\n\n| Player Choice | Patrol Reaction | Consequence |\n|--------------- | ----------------- | -------------|\n| Attack loud & fast | One goblin flees | +2 foes in next fight |\n| Sneak & succeed | Patrol none the wiser | PCs learn rhythm; advantage later |\n| Watch & wait | You roll d6 each turn (1 = spotted) | Builds dread |\n\nLesson: a single fleeing minion teaches *consequences* better than a TPK.\n\n---\n## 2.  Surprise & Distance - The Two Rolls That Matter\nThe biggest live-play hitch for new GMs is \"Uh... how far away are they?\"\n\n1. **Stealth vs. Passive Perception** decides *awareness.*  \n2. **Terrain table** (DM-screen) or 2d6×10 ft sets *distance* if outdoors; in rooms the map handles it.\n\nIf at least one side is unaware → declare them *surprised* (no actions, moves, or reactions round 1).  Write an \"S\" next to their initiative count.\n\nQuick rule-of-thumb: *If in doubt, skip the table and start at 30 ft.*  Keep the game moving.\n\n---\n## 3.  Enemy Intent - Why Do They Fight?\nWrite a one-line goal for every creature group:\n\n| Monster | Wants | Will Retreat When |\n|--------- | ------- | -------------------|\n| Goblins | Finish blood ritual | 50 % hp lost or watch dies |\n| Skeletons | Stop grave robbers | Turned / radiant damage taken |\n| Bandits | Get paid | Leader drops to 0 hp |\n\nHaving a trigger for retreat lets you portray **intelligent withdrawal**-and newbies *love* chasing fleeing foes.\n\n---\n## 4.  Running Combat Without Stalling\nColville's fast-combat hacks:\n\n- *One stealth roll* per side unless PCs insist on splitting.  \n- Group identical monsters on the same initiative.  \n- When a minion drops, narrate briefly, then point to next player-do **not** eulogise every goblin.  \n- Goblins shoot the *wizard*, not the fighter.  That single tactical choice sells realism.\n\nSpeed booster: give monsters 1d6+0 dmg flat.  Fewer math pauses.\n\n---\n## 5.  Describe With Three Senses\n\"What do you see, what do you hear, what do you smell?\"  Use this cadence at each doorway.\n\nExample (offering room):\n> Sight - Flickering brazier, knight carvings locked in eternal battle.  \n> Sound - Distant chant, echoing drip.  \n> Smell - Dry dust tinged with goblin dung.\n\nPlayers immediately picture the space *and* guess at threats (\"There *are* goblins ahead!\").\n\n---\n## 6.  Traps Teach Vigilance - Pressure Plate 101\n\n| Step | Narration / Mechanics |\n|------ | -----------------------|\n| Foreshadow | \"The floor ahead is strangely dust-free.\"  Ask: *\"How do you proceed?\"* |\n| Check? | If they probe, DC 12 Investigation to spot plate.  |\n| Spring | Missed? Attack +4, 2d6 slashing (scythe).  |\n| Lesson | Laugh, then place a second **dummy** trap later to watch them sweat. |\n\nAvoid \"gotcha\" damage that wipes 1st-level PCs.  Make traps hurt just enough to change player behaviour.\n\n---\n## 7.  Rest Decisions Drive Drama\nColville rule: **Any rest outside town risks a random encounter.**\n\n- Short rest → Roll d6; 1 = owlbear, goblin scouts, or weather hazard.  \n- Long rest → Two rolls plus move the ritual clock forward.\n\nAnnounce odds upfront: \"You *can* camp, but there's a 1-in-6 chance something finds you.\"  Players weigh risk vs. healing and feel smart either way.\n\n---\n## 8.  The Boss Room - Plan a Twist, Not a Spreadsheet\nThe Delian Tomb climaxes with a **bugbear chieftain** + shaman + terrified captive.\n\nDynamic beats you can steal:\n\n1. PCs see prisoner first → emotional stake.  \n2. Shaman chanting → built-in timer (3 rounds = sacrifice).  \n3. Bugbear offers **ransom** if a PC drops-surprising diplomacy moment.\n\nWrite *one* unexpected tactic for your boss and you're already ahead of most modules.\n\n---\n## 9.  Closing the Crawl\n1. **Treasure matters** - Place at least one consumable (healing potion) and one story item (knight's oath on the wall).  \n2. **Cliff-hanger** - Secret door slides open; cue session break.  \n3. **Debrief** - Ask players \"What scared you? What felt cool?\"; jot notes for next prep.\n\n---\n### Quick Reference: First-Dungeon DCs & Numbers\n- Patrol Stealth: +4  \n- Goblin Perception: +2  \n- \"Avoid rubble\" Acrobatics DC 10  \n- Iron-bound door Strength DC 15  \n- Trap scythe attack +4, 2d6 slashing\n\nKeep this list in the margin so you never pause to crack a book.\n\n---\n## Next Steps\nReady to expand beyond a single tomb?  Check out:\n- Storytelling.NarrativeTechniques.BuildingTension (for ritual timers & stakes)  \n- GameMechanics.ChallengeDesign.BalancingEncounters (tuning enemy counts)\n\nRun the crawl again for a different group.  Iterate.  You-like your dungeon-get better with each pass.\n\nHappy delving!  May your goblins always remember to scream for help.\n",
