        "content": "# Lore Organization and Prep: Surviving and Thriving as a GM\n\nA practical, multi-perspective guide to managing your campaign's lore, prepping efficiently, and keeping your world playable and fun-without drowning in your own notes. Synthesizing advice from The Fantasy Forge's [I was drowning in lore... until I did these 5 THINGS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZnYDXNrW60), Stephanie Plays Games, Bob World Builder, Ginny Di, and more.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR Checklist\n- [ ] Prep for the session, not the whole campaign\n- [ ] Use a connected, visual system for your notes (not just folders)\n- [ ] Make your lore actionable-put it in play, not just in your files\n- [ ] Use fewer tools, but use them consistently\n- [ ] Take notes for your future self-write with clarity and context\n\n**How to use this checklist:**\nBefore each session, review these points. Focus on what your players will see, do, and care about. After the session, update your notes so future you (or a stranger) can run the game from them.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Prep for the Session, Not the Saga\n> \"I used to sit down and try to write some Tolkien level 10 layer plot for every single campaign... and then my players would spend all this time trying to get into a locked bakery instead of caring about all that lore that I had created.\"  \n> -The Fantasy Forge, [I was drowning in lore... until I did these 5 THINGS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZnYDXNrW60)\n\n- Focus your prep on what's immediately in front of the players. If they're heading into a town, prep the town-not the whole kingdom.\n- Keep long-term ideas as bullet points or loose notes. Only flesh them out when the players move in that direction.\n- You are not a bad GM for not having everything mapped out. If you're burning out, scale back.\n\n**Related:** See [World Building](WorldBuilding) for more on starting small and expanding organically.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Use a Connected, Visual System for Notes\n> \"The real problem wasn't that I didn't have my notes. It's that they weren't connected... I need to see how one piece of lore connects to another.\"  \n> -The Fantasy Forge\n\n- A pile of Google Docs is still chaos if they don't talk to each other. Use a system that lets you link NPCs, locations, and events.\n- Tools like World Anvil, Notion, or even a well-structured wiki can help you visualize connections.\n- If you prefer analog, use mind maps or color-coded notebooks, but keep cross-references.\n- The system you actually use is better than the fanciest tool you never open.\n\n**Example:** World Anvil lets you click a town, see its ruler, and jump to their backstory instantly. Notion can do this with linked databases.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Make Your Lore Do Something\n> \"If my players don't encounter it, if they don't ask me about it, or it doesn't affect them, then it's not really part of my world... I like to think about Lore as a resource, not like a trophy.\"  \n> -The Fantasy Forge\n\n- Only prep lore that can come into play soon, or that you can hint at through NPCs, rumors, or challenges.\n- Ask yourself: Can my players run into this soon? How can I hint at it? How does it challenge or interest them?\n- Write down cool ideas, but don't overdevelop them until they're relevant.\n\n**Related:** See [Engaging Players: Making Lore and Adventure Compelling](GMingFoundations.EngagingPlayersMakingLoreAndAdventureCompelling) for more on actionable lore.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Use Fewer Tools, But Use Them More\n> \"You're not organizing by having all of those [tools]... you're just hoarding. I use fewer tools, but I use them more often.\"  \n> -The Fantasy Forge\n\n- Pick the one tool or system you actually open during prep and play. Ditch the rest, at least for now.\n- Whether it's Google Docs, World Anvil, a physical notebook, or Notion, consistency beats complexity.\n- You can always add more tools later if you need them.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Take Notes Like Your Future Self Depends on It\n> \"Now I write like I'm prepping for someone who's never seen this world before. Because future me is tired, distracted, and probably running the session after work...\"  \n> -The Fantasy Forge\n\n- Write notes with enough context that a stranger could run your game from them.\n- Avoid cryptic shorthand. Instead of \"remind them of the merchant,\" write \"Cassandra, the sharp-tongued apothecary who knows the mayor's secret.\"\n- Summarize scenes, NPCs, and locations with a sentence or two of context.\n- After each session, review and clarify your notes while the details are fresh.\n\n**Related:** See Bob World Builder's [D&D Note Taking: we're missing the point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu4syduu6-Q) and Ginny Di's [No time to take notes while DMing? Try this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UU40lr42tQ) for practical note-taking strategies.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Bonus: Decentralize Information and Stay Flexible\n- Prep secrets and clues that can be discovered in multiple ways, not just one path.\n- Use bullet points, mind maps, or scatterplots to keep your prep flexible and adaptable.\n- Only flesh out locations, NPCs, or lore when they're about to come into play.\n\n**Example:** Stephanie Plays Games recommends prepping 8-10 secrets or clues per session, and letting players discover them however they choose.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading & Resources\n- The Fantasy Forge: [I was drowning in lore... until I did these 5 THINGS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZnYDXNrW60)\n- Stephanie Plays Games: [Prep FAST, Prep FUN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiuOS2XMT9U)\n- Bob World Builder: [D&D Note Taking: we're missing the point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu4syduu6-Q)\n- Ginny Di: [No time to take notes while DMing?
