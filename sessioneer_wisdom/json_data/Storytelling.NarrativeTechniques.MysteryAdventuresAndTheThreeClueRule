        "content": "# Mystery Adventures and the Three Clue Rule\n\nRunning mysteries in tabletop RPGs is both a challenge and a delight. A well-crafted mystery can break up the rhythm of combat-heavy campaigns, reward different player skills, and create memorable, player-driven stories. This guide synthesizes the best actionable advice from Pointy Hat's [the ONE trick to make Better D&D Mysteries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_bzZ-pptk), Trekiros' [Steal my Dungeon (it's a Dragon)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7FlFkgq1S0), and foundational GM wisdom from The Alexandrian and others.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR Checklist: Running a Great Mystery Adventure\n- [ ] Know your group: tailor the mystery to their abilities and interests\n- [ ] Start from the end: define what happened (the solution)\n- [ ] Answer the three core questions: Who, Why, How\n- [ ] For each question, create at least three clues\n- [ ] Scatter clues throughout the adventure (not all in one place)\n- [ ] Use a variety of clue types (physical evidence, NPC testimony, environmental details, etc.)\n- [ ] Prepare friendly NPCs or in-fiction nudges as fail-safes\n- [ ] Use character abilities (Insight, Investigation, spells) to deliver hints\n- [ ] Allow for multiple solutions and approaches\n- [ ] End with a satisfying reveal or confrontation\n\n**How to use this checklist:**\nUse it as a prep tool when designing a mystery adventure. After each session, review which clues landed and which need reinforcement. Adjust the number and placement of clues to match your group's play style and needs.\n\n---\n\n## Why Run a Mystery Adventure?\n- **Breaks up the pace:** Mysteries offer a palate cleanser from combat, engaging different player skills and shifting the tone.\n- **Rewards new skills:** Deduction, reasoning, attention to detail, and creative problem-solving are all spotlighted.\n- **Showcases non-combat abilities:** Give value to spells, skills, and backgrounds that rarely shine in combat.\n- **Player agency:** Players feel clever when they solve the puzzle themselves.\n\n> \"Mysteries break up the pace of the story and offer a completely new type of challenge that gets your players out of combat brain and into a different brain... It's a really good palate cleanser that adds a much needed tone shift to the game.\"  \n> -Pointy Hat, [the ONE trick to make Better D&D Mysteries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_bzZ-pptk)\n\n---\n\n## The Pointy Hat Method: Building a Solvable Mystery\n\n### 1. Know Your Group\n- Don't start a campaign with a mystery-get to know your players and their characters first.\n- Tailor the mystery to the group's interests and abilities (e.g., avoid magic-based mysteries if a player can cast Detect Magic at will).\n\n### 2. Start from the End\n- Decide what actually happened. Was it a murder, a theft, a frame job, or something else?\n- Example: The \"victim\" faked their own death to frame a rival.\n\n### 3. Answer the Three Questions\n- **Who did it?** (The culprit)\n- **Why did they do it?** (The motive)\n- **How did they do it?** (The method)\n\n### 4. The Three Clue Rule (The Alexandrian)\n- For each question (Who, Why, How), create at least three clues that point to the answer.\n- If the method is complex, break it into parts and create clues for each part.\n- This redundancy ensures players can miss clues and still solve the mystery.\n\n> \"For every conclusion you want your players to reach, you must create three clues. The idea is that you don't know what your players are going to latch onto so you want there to be some redundancy.\"  \n> -Trekiros, [Steal my Dungeon (it's a Dragon)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7FlFkgq1S0) (summarizing The Alexandrian's Three Clue Rule)\n\n#### Example: Circus Frame-Up Mystery\n- **Who:** The circus owner faked his own death.\n  - Clue 1: Plans for a magical ring of reverse polymorph.\n  - Clue 2: Letters expressing jealousy and intent.\n  - Clue 3: Testimony from a loyal NPC about the owner's behavior.\n- **Why:** Jealousy over a rival's success.\n  - Clue 1: Financial records showing declining profits.\n  - Clue 2: Gossip among circus performers.\n  - Clue 3: A diary entry or overheard argument.\n- **How:** Used a polymorphed animal as a body double, charmed the rival, staged the scene.\n  - Clue 1: Magical residue or components.\n  - Clue 2: Unusual animal remains.\n  - Clue 3: Witness saw the rival acting strangely.\n\n---\n\n## Clue Types and Placement\n- **Physical evidence:** Items, documents, magical traces.\n- **NPC testimony:** What people saw, heard, or believe (even if mistaken).\n- **Environmental details:** Unusual marks, smells, or disturbances.\n- **Social clues:** Rumors, relationships, and motives.\n- **Magical clues:** Spells, enchantments, or magical effects.\n\nScatter clues in different locations and scenes. Some can be hidden, others in plain sight. Vary the difficulty and type to engage all players.\n\n---\n\n## Fail-Safes and Player Support\n- **Friendly NPCs:** Use them to nudge players if they're stuck, without breaking immersion.\n- **Character abilities:** Let high Intelligence, Insight, or Charisma provide extra hints or context.\n- **In-fiction nudges:** Remind players of places or people they haven't investigated.\n- **Multiple solutions:** Allow creative approaches and reward lateral thinking.\n\n---\n\n## Pacing, Tension, and the Role of Combat\n- Mysteries can (and often should) include moments of action or combat, especially as stakes escalate.\n- Use pacing techniques from [Narrative Techniques](Storytelling.NarrativeTechniques) to build tension and keep players engaged.\n- End with a reveal, confrontation, or twist that gives closure and satisfaction.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading and Resources\n- Pointy Hat's [the ONE trick to make Better D&D Mysteries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9_bzZ-pptk)\n- Trekiros' [Steal my Dungeon (it's a Dragon)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7FlFkgq1S0)\n- The Alexandrian's [Three Clue Rule](https://thealexandrian.net/creations/three-clue-rule)\n- [Narrative Techniques](Storytelling.NarrativeTechniques)\n\n---\n\nBy following this method, you'll create mysteries that are challenging, fair, and deeply satisfying for your players. Remember: the goal is not to stump your players, but to let them feel clever and engaged as they unravel the truth.",
