This document synthesizes advice from leading GMs and creators, providing actionable steps, checklists, and examples to help you craft memorable, self-contained adventures.\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR Checklist for Running a Great Oneshot\n- **Define the core emotion or theme** (whimsy, horror, mystery, etc.)\n- **Establish a strong, immediate hook** to get players invested fast\n- **Constrain the setting** to keep the adventure focused and on time\n- **Balance scenes**: aim for a mix of combat, roleplay, and problem-solving\n- **Design with time in mind**: plan for 3-5 hours, limit scenes and combats\n- **Make progression modular**: allow for optional content and non-linear solutions\n- **Prep key NPCs and clues**-but be ready to move them as needed\n- **Give every character a moment to shine**\n- **Communicate the adventure's tone and expectations to players**\n- **Plan a satisfying conclusion**-resolve the main arc, even if bittersweet\n\n*How to use this checklist:*\nBefore you start prepping, review this list. As you design, check off each item. If you're running short on time, focus on the top five.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What Makes a Great Oneshot?\nA oneshot is a self-contained adventure designed to be completed in a single session (typically 3-5 hours). It's ideal for introducing new players, experimenting with new systems, or providing a break from a long campaign.\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Clear, immediate stakes**\n- **Fast player buy-in**\n- **Tight pacing and structure**\n- **A satisfying arc with a clear resolution**\n\n> \"I start with an emotion I want to evoke with the entire arc. Is it whimsical, sad, scary? That guides everything else.\"  \n> - Jesse Jerdak, Ginny Di's [How to Write a One-Shot D&D Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZVsWRdms00)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Designing the Adventure\n\n### a. Start with the End in Mind\n- Decide what the climax looks like: a boss fight, a moral choice, a daring escape?\n- Work backwards to seed clues and obstacles that lead to this finale.\n\n### b. The Hook: Get Players Invested Fast\n- Open with action or a compelling problem-skip the tavern scene!\n- Present the stakes and the reason to care in the first 10 minutes.\n\n> \"You get to frame this, you get to set the stakes right out the gate. You as the author are in control of this.\"  \n> - Ginny Di, [How to Write a One-Shot D&D Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZVsWRdms00)\n\n### c. Constrain the Setting\n- Limit the physical and narrative space (a single town, dungeon, or event).\n- This keeps players focused and prevents the adventure from sprawling.\n\n> \"Constraining the setting is like mandatory. If you throw too much at folks, they're going to explore in a lot of different directions and that's where your time goes.\"  \n> - Jesse Jerdak, Ginny Di's [How to Write a One-Shot D&D Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZVsWRdms00)\n\n### d. Structure: Scenes and Pacing\n- Plan 3-5 major scenes or encounters.\n- Each combat takes ~45 minutes; limit to 1-2 if you want time for roleplay and puzzles.\n- Include optional or skippable content to keep things moving.\n\n> \"I like to have 30% combat, 30% RP, and 30% problem solving. Pretty much anything I write is going to have that 30/30/30.\"  \n> - Jesse Jerdak, Ginny Di's [How to Write a One-Shot D&D Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZVsWRdms00)\n\n### e. Modular Progression\n- Design so that essential clues or keys can be found in multiple places.\n- If players miss a clue, let them find it wherever they look next.\n\n> \"No matter what they're looking for, everywhere they're looking, that's where it is.\"  \n> - Jesse Jerdak, Ginny Di's [How to Write a One-Shot D&D Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZVsWRdms00)\n\n### f. Player Buy-In and Character Motivation\n- Present a problem that demands action.\n- If needed, tell players their characters care-it's a one-shot, not a campaign.\n- Use pre-generated characters or have a quick character creation session.\n\n> \"Talk with the players about ways they can already maybe know each other in the story, or they could always be a band of adventurers when they start.\"  \n> - Matt Mercer, Geek & Sundry's [Write One-Shot RPG Campaigns! (GM Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0fP5x-O9lg)\n\n### g. Communicate Tone and Expectations\n- Tell players what kind of adventure to expect (combat-heavy, mystery, etc.).\n- This helps them build appropriate characters and sets the right mood.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Prepping for Play\n\n### a. Prep Only What Matters\n- Focus on the core scenes, essential NPCs, and key clues.\n- Cut anything that doesn't serve the main arc or theme.\n\n> \"Prep key NPCs and clues-but be ready to move them as needed.\"  \n> - Matt Mercer, Geek & Sundry's [Write One-Shot RPG Campaigns! (GM Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0fP5x-O9lg)\n\n### b. Use the Lazy Dungeon Master's 8 Steps\n- Review the characters\n- Create a strong start\n- Outline scenes\n- Define fantastic locations\n- Choose relevant monsters/NPCs\n- List possible magic items or rewards\n- Prepare secrets and clues\n- Develop a strong ending\n\n> See Bob World Builder's [\"LAZY\" Dungeon Master PREP | Candlekeep Mysteries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5T3xHEVGS-4) for a practical walkthrough.\n\n### c. Time Management\n- Be ruthless about cutting scenes if you're running long.\n- Have an NPC or event ready to nudge players forward if they stall.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Running the Oneshot\n\n### a. Keep the Pace Up\n- Move clues and NPCs to wherever the players are.\n- Don't be afraid to skip scenes or combine encounters.\n\n### b. Spotlight Every Character\n- Give each player a moment to shine, tailored to their abilities or backstory.\n\n### c. Allow for Player Agency\n- Let players solve problems their way, even if it's not what you planned.\n- Be flexible-improvise when needed.\n\n### d. End with Impact\n- Resolve the main arc, even if the ending is bittersweet or open-ended.\n- Offer a brief epilogue or \"where are they now?\" for each character.\n\n> \"Prepare some fun short epilogues for each character describing their victorious sunset or vicious death.\"  \n> - Matt Mercer, Geek & Sundry's [Write One-Shot RPG Campaigns! (GM Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0fP5x-O9lg)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Advanced: Standalone Adventures and Worldbuilding\n- Use oneshots to explore new settings, test campaign ideas, or flesh out your world's history.\n- Standalone adventures (4-10 sessions) can be structured like a movie: setup, investigation, climax, resolution.\n- Let characters and events from oneshots reappear as NPCs or legends in your main campaign.\n\n> \"If there is a historic moment in your world's past, play through it. If there's a character or setting you want to introduce, do it through a standalone adventure.\"  \n> - Dalia, Mystic Arts' [Worldbuild with Standalone Adventures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA8DR2vtEhk)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Example Oneshot Structure\n\n### The PMs Method: Premise, Monster, Structure\n> \"The process of coming up with a plot is all about asking yourself questions and then answering them, or in the case of open questions, making sure there isn't an obvious correct answer. That's the key to any open question in RPGs: the DM can't answer it. Otherwise, it's not an open question. Let your players debate and disagree.\"  \n> - Mystic Arts, [How One-Shots can tell a story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhVMLWEEhEQ)\n\n- **Premise**: Start with a dramatic question. What are the antagonists doing? Why do the players care? What can be done about it? What happens if the players fail? (Motivation, Intention, Stakes)\n- **Monster**: Choose your main antagonist or threat. This could be a literal monster, a villain, or a situation.\n- **Structure**: Use a story structure like the Five Room Dungeon (see below) to organize your adventure into scenes or beats, not just physical rooms.\n\n### Five Room Dungeon as Story Structure\nA five room dungeon is a flexible story structure, not just a literal dungeon. Each \"room\" is a scene or story beat:\n\n1. **Entrance/Inciting Incident**: The party is thrust into action (e.g., invited to a suspicious dinner by the villain, or a festival interrupted by a monster attack).\n2. **Puzzle/Roleplay Challenge**: Players face a social or investigative challenge (e.g., tense dialogue with the villain, uncovering secrets, or solving a puzzle).\n3. **Setback/Complication**: A twist, trap, or second wave of enemies complicates the situation, draining resources or raising the stakes.\n4. **Climax**: The final confrontation or big reveal (e.g., a boss fight, a moral dilemma, or a sudden new threat).\n5. **Resolution**: Wrap up the story, reward the players, and offer epilogues. Consider leaving an open question or moral ambiguity for the players to debate.\n\n> \"Rooms are just scenes, dungeons are just adventures, and story structures aren't spaces. All stories exist in a structure. Humans are hard coded to hear and tell stories. It's in our bones.\"  \n> - Mystic Arts, [How One-Shots can tell a story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhVMLWEEhEQ)\n\n#### Example: Tyrant Protectors (from Mystic Arts)\n- **Premise**: Bandits have taken over a town, oppressing the people. But their protection may be the only thing keeping the town safe from greater threats. Do the ends justify the means?\n- **Monster**: The Hungry Mutts, led by Gregor Helt.\n- **Structure**:\n    1. **Entrance**: The party is invited to the bandit leader's tower for a tense dinner.\n    2. **Puzzle/Roleplay**: Social challenge with Gregor, who tries to justify his rule and intimidate the party.\n    3. **Setback**: Combat erupts, with reinforcements arriving as a second wave.\n    4. **Climax**: Just as the party thinks they've won, a new threat (e.g., an ankheg) emerges, forcing a final confrontation.\n    5. **Resolution**: The town is freed (or not), but the moral question remains unresolved.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n- The five room structure is about pacing and variety, not literal rooms.\n- You can shuffle the order of scenes to fit your story.\n- Open, dramatic questions create memorable, player-driven stories.\n- Each scene should have a clear purpose: introduce, challenge, complicate, climax, resolve.\n\n> \"If you want to make sure your episodic story doesn't fall flat, you can add the relevant story beats. Sometimes I'm running a game and I'm thinking, huh? I've had the entrance and the puzzle and the setback. If I can just add climax and a resolution, we've got a good session on our hands. A whole story.\"  \n> - Mystic Arts, [How One-Shots can tell a story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhVMLWEEhEQ)\n\n---\n\n## 7.

Special Considerations and Advanced Tips\n\n### a. Oneshots for New Players\n- Oneshots are an ideal way to introduce new players to TTRPGs. Keep rules light, use pre-generated characters, and focus on fun over complexity.\n- \"It's our duty, dear game masters, to provide a safe environment for these new players... Don't overwhelm them by suggesting all the things you think are badass. They're there to play the characters from their fantasies.\"  \n- Satine Phoenix, Geek & Sundry's [New Players (GM Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxnrhClNmak)\n- Gradually introduce rules as needed, and let new players learn by doing rather than memorizing.\n\n### b. Minimalism and the Beauty of Limitations\n- Embrace minimalism: limit choices, locations, and mechanics to focus creativity and keep the story clear.\n- \"Limiting choices allows you to communicate more efficiently. Things like story are more clear. I like to use this in my adventures. Players will overthink everything. Simplifying takes my prep time down as well.\"  \n- Satine Phoenix, Geek & Sundry's [The Beauty of Limitations (GM Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpqPFqxdTmo)\n- One-page RPGs and minimalist systems (like Honey Heist, Lasers & Feelings, or Roll for Shoes) are excellent for oneshots, especially with new or casual groups.\n\n### c. Improvisation and Handling Derailments\n- Be ready to improvise and move story elements as needed. If players go off track, adapt by shifting clues, NPCs, or encounters to wherever they go.\n- \"Your players are there for the adventure. They don't know what you don't know, so be ready to improv or take pieces of the story you've made for them and redesign to fit the path they want to go down.\"  \n- Satine Phoenix, Geek & Sundry's [When Stories Derail! (GM Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2euH1sQugQg)\n- Take breaks if you need to regroup, and let players take the lead when they have a plan.\n\n### d. Quick Buy-In and Roleplay\n- For oneshots, it's okay to tell players their characters care about the adventure's hook-fast buy-in is more important than deep backstory.\n- Encourage roleplay by modeling it yourself and giving players a reason to engage, even in a short session. Use broad archetypes for NPCs to make them memorable quickly.\n- \"If you want to encourage your players to role play, you should show them how by role playing, they will take your lead.\"  \n- Satine Phoenix, Geek & Sundry's [Player Roleplay w/ Taliesin Jaffe (GM Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQZR4smjUEc)\n\n### e. One-Page RPGs and Alternative Systems\n- Consider using one-page RPGs or rules-light systems for oneshots. These games are easy to teach, quick to play, and encourage creativity.\n- Examples: Honey Heist, Lasers & Feelings, Roll for Shoes, All Outta Bubblegum, Everyone is John.\n- Minimalist systems are especially good for improv-heavy or comedic oneshots, but can also deliver powerful stories.\n\n---\n\n## 10.
