        "content": "# Battlefield Actions\nMaking the environment an extension of the monster.\n\nA battlefield action is **any game effect that originates from the space rather than from the creature's stat-block.**  Lair actions, mythic actions, villain actions (4e), collapsing ceilings, exploding crystals, timed locks - they all serve the same goal:  \n1) increase the monster's effective action economy without bloating its turn, and  \n2) force the party to *move, think, and prioritise* every round.\n\nThis guide walks you through designing, pacing, and running battlefield actions from scratch or bolting them onto an existing creature.\n\n---\n## TLDR Lightning Checklist\n- [ ] Does the battlefield do *something* every round the monster is alive?  \n- [ ] Is each action telegraphed so players can react?  \n- [ ] Does at least one action **disrupt safe spots** (cover, back-row, perches)?  \n- [ ] Is there a clear rule trigger (initiative 20, start of round, bloodied)?  \n- [ ] Clock or condition that can *turn it off*?  \n- [ ] Variety - no two actions roll the same save or deal the same damage type.  \n- [ ] Can you track it in one sentence behind the screen?\n\n> \"Treat the lair like the boss's favourite magic item.  If it isn't worth an attunement slot, cut it.\"  \n> - Matthew Colville, *Using 4E to Make 5E Combat More Fun* (YouTube)\n\nHow to use this list: tick the boxes during prep; the more you check, the more dynamic the fight will feel.  You rarely need *all* of them.\n\n---\n## 1. Choose a Battlefield Role\nBattlefield actions come in four broad flavours.  Pick 1-2 that fit your theme:\n\n| Role | Purpose | Fast Examples |\n|------ | --------- | ---------------|\n| **Pressure** | Punish turtling / stalling. | Rising magma (+1 die damage each round), collapsing ice shelves. |\n| **Control** | Shape movement lanes & sight lines. | Shadow curtains that grant full cover; grappling roots that create difficult terrain. |\n| **Support** | Directly buff / heal the monster or its minions. | Necrotic mist grants temp HP; arcane pylons recharge legendary resistances. |\n| **Narrative** | Communicate stakes or countdowns. | Demonic ritual track (4 successes = TPK); civilians on conveyor toward grinder.\n\nIf the monster already dishes out a lot of raw damage (e.g., Ancient Red Dragon), lean into Control or Narrative instead of more Pressure.\n\n---\n## 2. Pick a Trigger\nKeep it predictable so the table can plan around it:\n\n| Trigger | When it Fires |\n|--------- | --------------|\n| **Initiative 20 (loses ties)** | Classic 5e lair action slot. |\n| **Round Clock** | \"At the end of round 3. ..\" Good for big set-piece events. |\n| **Bloodied / Phase Change** | Monster hits ½ HP, new terrain hazard activates. References [Action-Oriented Monsters](Combat.MonsterDesign.ActionOrientedMonsters). |\n| **Player-Driven** | Opening sarcophagus, destroying crystal, stepping on rune.\n\nAvoid random triggers; consistency > surprise.\n\n---\n## 3. Design the Action (Template)\nWrite it like a spell block.  Use this template and plug in numbers from the quick table.\n\n> **Falling Chandeliers (Initiative 20, once each)**  \n> The chandeliers crash in a line 30 ft long × 5 ft wide.  Creatures underneath make a DC 14 Dex save, taking 3d8 bludgeoning + 2d6 fire on a fail or half on a success.  The area becomes *difficult terrain* and is *lightly obscured* by smoke.\n\n### Quick-Number Table (works at any tier)\n\n| Tier | Attack / Save DC | Damage Dice | Secondary Effect |\n|------ | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------|\n| 1-4 | +5 / 13 | 2d6-3d6 | 1 round condition |\n| 5-10 | +8 / 16 | 4d6-6d6 | 2 rounds or terrain |\n| 11-16 | +11 / 18 | 8d6-10d6 | Ongoing dmg 1d6 |\n| 17-20 | +14 / 21 | 12d6-14d6 | 3 rounds / debuff |\n\nUse *half* those dice for wide AOEs; full dice for single-target beams.\n\n---\n## 4. Give Players Counterplay\nBattlefield actions are exciting only if the party can influence them.\n\n1. **Disable** - Arcane crystals (AC 15, 40 HP) power the lightning grid.  \n2. **Mitigate** - A DC 14 Nature check lets a druid predict where the next ice spike erupts, granting advantage on saves.  \n3. **Reverse** - Shove an enemy into the lava channel; the hazard doesn't care who burns.  \n\nAim for at least one of these levers.\n\n---\n## 5. Pace & Escalate\n\n*Round 1*: Low-noise cue - rumbling ground, flickering runes.  \n*Round 2-3*: Moderate hazard every round.  \n*Round 4+* (or bloodied): Increase dice, shrink safe zones, or add a second effect.\n\nEscalation keeps veterans from solving the puzzle once and then autopiloting.\n\n---\n## 6. Plug-and-Play d8 Table\nRoll or choose.\n\n| d8 | Battlefield Action |\n|--- | ---|\n| 1 | **Geyser Vents** - Steam erupts in 10-ft radius pillars, Con save or 4d6 fire & blinded 1 rnd.  Vents relocate each round. |\n| 2 | **Bone Pits** - Floor panels drop; Dex save or 30-ft fall into spikes (3d10).  Panels reset magically next round. |\n| 3 | **Wild Magic Rift** - 15-ft cube of swirling colour. Entering/starting turn triggers a roll on d6 Wild Surge list. |\n| 4 | **Grasping Vines** - 20-ft radius becomes difficult terrain; Str save or restrained. Vines burn away after 2 rounds. |\n| 5 | **Mirror Shards** - Floating mirrors grant the villain half cover and reflect the next ranged spell (spell attack vs original caster). Destroyable (AC 12, 15 HP). |\n| 6 | **Frost Quake** - Ice cracks; creatures on ground Dex save or prone & slide 10 ft toward crevasse. |\n| 7 | **Haunting Chant** - Disembodied choir; Wis save or frightened of centre rune until end of next turn. Destroying rune ends effect. |\n| 8 | **Meteor Debris** - Tiny meteors rain in 60-ft sphere; Dex save or 6d6 bludgeoning & ignition (1d6 fire start of each turn, action to douse). |\n\n---\n## 7. Running Tips at the Table\n1. **Describe before you roll** - players should always get a hint.  \n2. Track hazards with coloured poker chips or sticky notes on the map.  \n3. End of your monster's turn? *Describe terrain again*; remind them of options.  \n4. If everyone forgets an ongoing hazard for a round, **let it go** - flow beats fidelity.\n\n---\n## 8. Worked Example - CR 7 Encounter\n*Frostbound Medusa* in a ruined gallery.\n\n- Base creature: Medusa (CR 6) with frost theme & +20 HP.  \n- Adds 2 ice mephit minions (HP 1 each, [see Kitbash Process](Combat.MonsterDesign.8StepKitbashMonsterProcess)).\n\nBattlefield Actions (Initiative 20):\n1. **Shattering Glass (odd rounds)** - Icicles drop in 15-ft cube, Dex 15 or 4d6 cold + restrained by shards (Str 15 to break).  \n2. **Biting Wind (even rounds)** - 30-ft cone blasts from broken window, Con 15 or 2d8 cold & speed 0 until start of own turn.\n\nCounterplay: boarding up windows (Dex/Int check + action) cancels next Wind; lighting braziers (Str/Dex to topple) halves Shattering Glass dice within 10 ft.\n\nNotice how the actions encourage: keep moving, break line-of-sight vs gaze, use torches - and give martial PCs something to *do* besides swing.\n\n---\n## 9.
