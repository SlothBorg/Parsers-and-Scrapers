These steps help you reframe your prep and in-game tactics to make your world matter to your players.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why Players Aren't Engaged (And Why That's Okay)\nMany GMs worry that their players aren't \"engaged\" with the world or lore. But as Matthew Colville points out, if your players are having fun, that's already a win. Often, the issue is that GMs want players to care about the worldbuilding for its own sake, but most players are there for adventure, not lore dumps.\n\n> \"Worldbuilding is something we as DMs do because we like it. It's mostly for us. It's not really for the players... Players generally want adventure, not lore.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Engaging Your Players | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iWeZ-i19dk)\n\n## 2. Make Lore Relevant: Tie It to Urgent Problems\nPlayers will only care about your lore if it becomes the solution to a problem they can't solve with their character sheet. This means:\n- Presenting urgent, personal problems (threats to NPCs, places, or things the PCs care about)\n- Making the solution require knowledge of your world (lore as the key to progress)\n\n### Example: The \"Chase Them Up a Tree\" Technique\nColville recommends treating PCs like action heroes in movies: they are reactive, not proactive. They only act when forced by circumstances.\n\n> \"The way you make them active is to give them something to react to... chase them up a tree, back them into a corner, give them problems they can't solve with their character sheet.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Engaging Your Players | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iWeZ-i19dk)\n\n#### How to Do This:\n- Threaten something the PCs care about (a town, a family member, a beloved NPC)\n- If PCs have no attachments, threaten them directly (disease, curses, loss of something valuable)\n- Avoid taking away class abilities; instead, give something cool, then threaten to take it away\n- Start with local stakes (disease in the village) before escalating to world-ending threats\n\n### Example Adventure Hook:\n- A magical disease spreads through the town. The only cure is hidden in a part of your world the players have ignored. Now, your lore is the solution.\n\n## 3. Plot Coupons: Making Lore Actionable\nBorrowing from pulp and action movies, use \"plot coupons\"-items, people, or secrets that must be collected to solve the adventure. Each coupon is tied to a piece of your world or lore.\n\n- The villain is invincible except for a weakness tied to a legendary artifact (hidden in a location you want the players to explore)\n- An NPC knows the way through a dangerous forest, but has their own motivations and ties to your world's factions\n\n> \"You can take any lore in your world and wrap it in one of these little plot coupon envelopes and then chase the heroes up a tree and tell them the only way to get down is to collect those envelopes.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Engaging Your Players | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iWeZ-i19dk)\n\n## 4. Make Accessing Lore Easy, Fun, and Memorable\nOnce players are motivated to seek out lore, don't make it a slog. Make it easy and enjoyable to get the information they need-but also make it memorable and interactive.\n\n- Use NPCs, magical items, or in-world artifacts as \"lore delivery systems\"\n- Make these systems interactive and fun (e.g., a talking magic item, a mysterious book, a quirky sage)\n- Gate information with fun obstacles, not just research rolls\n- Consider making the lore delivery system a character in its own right, with a voice, personality, or even its own goals\n- If you don't want to reveal something yet (or don't know the answer), make the system incomplete-players must quest to unlock more answers\n\n> \"Make it easy for your players to learn about your world. Make it easy for them to get answers to obscure questions... The adventure should be hard, just getting the answer to a question-it's okay to make that easy.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Lore Delivery Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tBXnD9g0XY)\n\n#### Example Lore Delivery Systems (from Matthew Colville's [Lore Delivery Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tBXnD9g0XY)):\n- **The Ruby Arm**: A magic arm that answers questions, but is missing fingers. Each finger is a quest to recover, gating more information. The arm has a voice and personality, making every interaction memorable.\n- **The Annals/Chronicle**: A book of history the party can consult for answers. But if it's just a book, it may feel like homework-make it interactive, or have a character read from it in a dramatic voice.\n- **The Glass Hand**: Inspired by classic sci-fi, a sentient artifact that answers questions, but is incomplete. Each missing part is a quest, and the hand's personality makes it fun to use.\n- **Tuning Forks**: A set of magical tuning forks, each revealing a different secret when struck. Players must find more forks to unlock more answers.\n- **Animated Coin**: A coin that answers yes/no questions by changing the monarch's expression. Simple, but can be made fun with a quirky personality.\n\n> \"If they ask you something you don't want them to know yet, or something you don't have an answer for, you just make a note and say, 'I am incomplete. I can serve you better if I am complete.' In other words: go find my missing pieces!\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Lore Delivery Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tBXnD9g0XY)\n\n**Tips for GMs:**\n- Make the lore delivery system something you enjoy portraying. If it makes you smile or cackle, your players will feel that energy.\n- Don't be afraid to make the system a little mysterious or quirky. The more fun you have, the more memorable it will be for your players.\n- If your players aren't engaging with a lore delivery system, try making it more interactive or giving it a voice/personality.\n- Remember: easy access to lore doesn't cheapen your world. The challenge should be in what the players do with the knowledge, not in getting it.\n\n> \"If you have a choice between easy but boring versus hard but fun, the players will pick the fun option. Make it easy, but make it fun.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Lore Delivery Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tBXnD9g0XY)\n\n## 5. Accept Player Agency and Fun\nNot all players will care about your lore, and that's okay. Your job is to make the world feel real and to make the lore matter when it needs to. If players are having fun, you're already succeeding.\n\n> \"I don't need my players to care much about my lore. A little is enough. I do expect my players to care about it when I make it relevant, when I make it urgent, when I chase them up a tree and they start wondering how they're gonna get down and suddenly my lore is real interesting to them.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Engaging Your Players | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iWeZ-i19dk)\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading & Related Topics\n- For actionable advice on lore management, prep, and keeping your world fun and manageable, see [Lore Organization and Prep: Surviving and Thriving as a GM](WorldBuilding.LoreOrganizationAndPrep).\n\n- [Session Zero Essentials](GMingFoundations.SessionZeroEssentials): Building party ties and motivations\n- [Narrative Techniques](Storytelling.NarrativeTechniques): More on structuring adventure hooks and story beats\n- [Lore Delivery Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tBXnD9g0XY): Colville's full video on making lore accessible\n\n---\n\n## For Advanced GMing & Meta-Level Advice\nFor advice on managing expectations, avoiding burnout, and meta-level skills for veteran GMs, see [Advanced GMing & Meta-Level Advice](GMingFoundations.AdvancedGmingNMetaLevelAdvice).\n\n## Inspiring Example: The Cult of the Reptile God\nColville describes running the classic adventure \"Cult of the Reptile God\" by inventing personal hooks (a sibling's letters) and escalating threats (cultists, thieves' guild) until the players had no choice but to engage. When the players started asking questions about the cult and the town, they were finally engaging with the world and its lore.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n- Focus on adventure, not just lore\n- Make lore the solution to urgent, unsolvable problems\n- Use plot coupons and interactive lore delivery systems\n- Accept that not all players will care about lore for its own sake\n- If players are having fun, you're doing it right\n\n> \"If you think of the PCs as action heroes who need to be backed into a corner, chased up a tree, put into dire circumstances, then they will start behaving like heroes and the game becomes a lot more fun for everyone.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Engaging Your Players | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iWeZ-i19dk)\n",
