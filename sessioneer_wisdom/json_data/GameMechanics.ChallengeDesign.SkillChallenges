Born in 4E D&D, the framework ports cleanly to 5E, PbtA clocks, Savage Worlds Dramatic Tasks, and other systems whenever you want suspense without round-by-round combat.\n\n---\n## TL;DR Checklist\n- [ ] Clear objective & stakes stated out loud\n- [ ] Tell players: *\"You're in a Skill Challenge; 6 successes before 3 failures.\"*\n- [ ] Give 2-3 example skills that will **definitely work**  \n  (primes creativity instead of paralysis)\n- [ ] Require proficiency / narrative fit for each attempt\n- [ ] One roll = one attempt; no repeating the *same* skill by the *same* PC\n- [ ] Set DCs & wild-card benefits (e.g., 18+ counts as 2 successes)\n- [ ] Establish consequences for **each failure** *and* for **total failure**\n- [ ] Allow ally reactions (Aid, Mitigate, Undo) to keep tension high\n- [ ] Track successes / failures visibly (tokens, whiteboard, VTT)\n- [ ] Close with a cinematic description of victory *or* fallout\n\nHow to Use the Checklist:  \nRun through it once during prep.  At the table keep the list beside you; tick each box as you explain or adjudicate.  You'll never forget a rule mid-scene again.\n\n---\n## 1. Declare Purpose & Stakes\n- *Escape the Black Keep before it collapses* (Colville)  \n- *Resurrect the fallen hero before their soul drifts away* (Mercer)  \n- *Slow the kaiju until high-level allies arrive*  \n\nState what happens on success, on failure, and what each failed roll costs (time, HP, guards added, etc.).\n\n---\n## 2. Choose Difficulty\n| Party Tier | Easy | Standard | Hard | Deadly |\n|------------ | ------ | ---------- | ------ | --------|\n| 1-4        | 4    | **6**    | 8    | 10     |\n| 5-10       | 5    | **8**    | 10   | 12     |\n| 11+        | 6    | **10**   | 12   | 15     |\n*# = required successes before 3 failures.  Adjust freely.*\n\nDC Guidelines (5E style):\n- Routine 10   - Tricky 13   - Risky 15   - Heroic 18   - Legendary 20+\n\nTip:  Mix DCs-easy options keep everyone rolling, high DC stunts earn double successes.\n\n---\n## 3. Offer Starter Skills\nGive 2-3 obvious routes.\n\nEscape Keep example:\n- Survival → retrace route (DC 13; 18+ = 2 successes)  \n- Insight → spot shortcuts (DC 15)  \n- Investigation → find secret doors (DC 15)\n\nEverything else is player-facing improv: *\"Tell me HOW Nature helps here.\"*  If the narration fits, allow it, set a DC, roll.\n\n---\n## 4. Table Rules (Recommended House Mix)\n1. Proficiency or believable rationale required.  \n2. No PC repeats the same skill twice.  Others may.  \n3. Each failed check triggers a setback:  \n   - Environmental damage (2d6 rockfall)  \n   - Lose 1 success already earned  \n   - Countdown clock advances (e.g., ritual progress 1 / 3)  \n4. Two reaction options:\n   - **Aid**: Another PC rolls to grant advantage (counts as their turn).  \n   - **Rescue**: Acrobatics/Perception to negate or absorb the failure's damage.\n\n---\n## 5. Running the Scene\n1. Announce challenge & conditions.  Place three red tokens (failures) and six green tokens (successes) where all can see.\n2. Ask \"Who goes first, and what do you try?\"\n3. Resolve checks clockwise.  Move a token each time.\n4. Sprinkle description: debris falling, wind howling, spectral tethers straining...\n5. When tokens are gone, narrate victory or disaster; apply aftermath (XP, treasure, wounds, plot twists).\n\n---\n## 6. Designing Memorable SCs\n- Use the environment: rising water, unstable ice, crowds, arcane backlash.  \n- Layer clocks: guards arrive in 8 rounds *and* ceiling collapses in 6 failures.  \n- Vary stakes: reputation, information, morale-not just HP.  \n- Reward ingenuity with advantage, extra successes, or story boons.  \n- Allow *partial* success-reach the surface but still lose the magic sword.\n\n---\n## 7. Example Templates\n### A) Collapsing Dungeon (Escape)\nSuccesses Needed: 6  Fail Limit: 3  DC 13-18  \nFailure Cost: 2d6 bludgeoning & delay  \nOn Total Failure: Each PC must pass DC 15 Ath/Acro or be buried (0 HP).\n\n### B) Resurrection Ritual (Persuade the Soul)\nSuccesses: 5 · Failures: 3  \nContributing skills: Religion, Persuasion, Performance, History (shared memories), Arcana (focus glyphs)  \nEach failure raises DC by +2; success lowers it by 2.  \nTotal Failure = permanent death; Total Success = return at full HP.\n\n### C) Rooftop Chase (Pursuit)\nGoal: Catch assassin before 3rd city bell.  \nUse Contest variant:  Each success moves party 1 range closer; each failure widens gap.  On 3 distance units, target escapes.  Include obstacles (Jump, Acrobatics), crowd (Intimidation), shortcut (Athletics 18 = 2 successes).\n\n---\n## 8. Adapting Beyond D&D\n- **Powered by the Apocalypse** - treat each roll as a Move; 6-, 7-9, 10+ replicate failure/partial/success tokens.  \n- **Savage Worlds** - Dramatic Task: 5 tokens in 5 rounds; bennies replicate Aid.  \n- **Cypher System** - GM sets task level; each player contributes one Action per round toward the running total.\n\n---\n## Common Pitfalls & Fixes\n| Pitfall | Fix |\n|--------- | -----|\n| Same 2 skills spammed | One-per-PC rule; raise DC after each repeat |\n| Only one player rolls | Hard-cap: no consecutive turns; encourage creative angles |\n| Feels abstract / disconnected | Use sensory narration and tangible consequences every roll |\n| Too swingy at low levels | Lower DCs, allow group advantage, or give *Effort* points convertible to successes |\n\n---\nKeep the pace brisk, celebrate every idea, and remember: a Skill Challenge is just collaborative fiction with dice-driven suspense.  Lean into the story beats, and your table will beg for the next one.\n\n# Skill Challenges\n\nA collaborative framework for group problem-solving, especially useful for travel, exploration, and complex obstacles-drawing on advice from Matthew Colville, Ginny Di, and others.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR: Skill Challenge Best Practices\n- [ ] Use when you want the whole party to contribute to overcoming a challenge\n- [ ] Set a clear goal and stakes for the challenge\n- [ ] Let players describe how they use their skills-require justification\n- [ ] Restrict repeated use of the same skill or require proficiency\n- [ ] Set a target number of successes before a set number of failures (e.g., 4 before 3)\n- [ ] Vary DCs based on skill relevance and situation\n- [ ] Make failures meaningful-complications, extra encounters, or altered outcomes\n- [ ] Use for travel, chases, negotiations, environmental hazards, and more\n\n**How to Use This Checklist:**\nWhen planning a skill challenge, define the goal, set the stakes, and let players get creative. Track successes and failures, and narrate the evolving situation.\n\n---\n\n## What is a Skill Challenge?\nA skill challenge is a structured way for the whole party to work together to overcome a complex obstacle-like navigating dangerous wilderness, escaping a collapsing dungeon, or negotiating with a hostile faction.\n\n> \"Skill challenges help the Dungeon Master encourage players to work together on something. It's a very flexible framework... The players tell you what skills they're going to use and how they're going to use them. They have to narrate or justify their use of the skill.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Making Travel Interesting | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvQ2JgZIjVI)\n\n---\n\n## Running a Skill Challenge\n1. **Set the Goal:** What are the players trying to achieve? (e.g., reach a destination, cross a river, win over an NPC)\n2. **Set the Stakes:** What happens if they succeed or fail? (e.g., avoid combat, gain an ally, trigger a complication)\n3. **Choose Skills:** Let players propose skills and justify their use. Restrict repeated use or require proficiency.\n4. **Set Success/Failure Thresholds:** Commonly 3-6 successes before 3 failures.\n5. **Vary DCs:** Adjust based on skill relevance and situation.\n6. **Narrate Outcomes:** Each roll should change the situation-describe progress, setbacks, and evolving challenges.\n7. **Make Failure Matter:** Failure doesn't mean \"you don't get there\"-it means extra encounters, lost resources, or new complications.\n\n---\n\n## Example: Travel Skill Challenge\n- **Goal:** Navigate through haunted woods to reach a ruin\n- **Stakes:** Fewer failures = avoid combat; more failures = tougher encounter or lost time\n- **Skills:** Survival (track paths), Arcana (sense magic), Athletics (clear obstacles), Persuasion (calm frightened NPC)\n- **Threshold:** 4 successes before 3 failures\n- **Outcome:** On success, party arrives safely; on failure, they face a dangerous encounter or setback. The encounter difficulty may be tied to the number of failures\n",
