        "content": "# Stores\n\nGeneral stores are a staple of fantasy towns, but they can be much more than a list of mundane goods. A well-designed store can ground your setting, provide adventure hooks, and create memorable NPC interactions. This guide synthesizes advice from Master the Dungeon, Ginny Di, and other TTRPG experts to help you make your stores vibrant, useful, and fun.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR Checklist\n- [ ] Design the store around the town's needs, not just adventurers\n- [ ] Give the shopkeeper a quirk and a goal\n- [ ] Stock inventory based on local resources and trade\n- [ ] Prepare a simple, realistic layout (counter service, storeroom)\n- [ ] Set cash limits and dynamic pricing\n- [ ] Use buy lists for adventure hooks\n- [ ] Consider security and theft deterrents\n- [ ] Decide on your shopping experience: roleplay, mechanics, or a mix\n- [ ] Add memorable items, not just generic gear\n\n**How to use this checklist:** Use it when prepping a new store or refreshing an old one. Add detail as players interact more deeply, and use the store as a springboard for quests, rumors, and worldbuilding.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Store Purpose & Stocking Philosophy\n> \"A general store is not really for adventurers... General stores exist for the local people in the town they're in. Their stock primarily comes from merchants and they rarely make anything on their own.\"  \n-Master the Dungeon, [Making Better D&D Towns: How to Make D&D General Stores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJiPs0oVDlk)\n\n- **Stock reflects local needs:** Rope, rations, tools, and bulk goods are for workers, not just adventurers.\n- **Inventory is fluid:** Unpopular items are replaced quickly; rare or expensive items are for clout or special trades.\n- **Local flavor:** Tie inventory to the town's industry (e.g., nets in fishing towns, lanterns in mining towns).\n\n### Comprehensive Inventory Table\n\n| Item                        | Price (gp) | Notes/Local Variant Example                  |\n|----------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------|\n| Rope (50 ft)                | 1          | Essential for workers and travelers         |\n| Flour (sack)                | 2          | Bulk staple, rarely bought by PCs           |\n| Simple tools (hammer, saw)  | 1-5        | Varies by local trade (e.g., fishing nets)  |\n| Rations (1 day)             | 0. 5        | For loggers, hunters, miners                |\n| Oil (flask)                 | 1          | Cooking, lamps, machinery                   |\n| Healing salve               | 10         | Rare, kept in small quantities              |\n| Prize item (e.g. sword)     | 100+       | Displayed for clout, rarely sold            |\n| Lantern, hooded             | 5          | Mining towns may have special variants      |\n| Nails (box of 100)          | 1          | Construction, repairs                       |\n| Salt (pound)                | 0. 5        | Preserving food, trade good                 |\n| Candles (dozen)             | 1          | Used in homes, temples                      |\n| Soap (bar)                  | 0. 2        | Local scents/flavors                        |\n| Ink (vial)                  | 10         | Scribes, contracts, rare in rural towns     |\n| Parchment (sheet)           | 0. 5        | Often reused, sometimes made from odd hides |\n| Local specialty (e.g. honey)| 2-10       | Unique to region, can be a quest hook       |\n| Potions (minor healing)     | 50         | Only in larger towns, often locked up       |\n| Spices (small pouch)        | 5          | Expensive, imported, status symbol          |\n| Boots, sturdy               | 2          | For travelers, miners, farmers              |\n| Blanket, wool               | 1          | Cold climates, often homespun               |\n| Water skin                  | 1          | Travelers, herders                          |\n| Cheese (wheel)              | 3          | Local dairy, varies by region               |\n| Ale (jug)                   | 0. 5        | Local breweries, quality varies             |\n| Tobacco (pouch)             | 1          | Social, sometimes magical                   |\n| Lock (simple)               | 10         | Security, rare in poor towns                |\n| Fishing tackle              | 1          | Essential in river/lake towns               |\n| Firewood (bundle)           | 0. 2        | Sold in cold or forested regions            |\n| Bread (loaf)                | 0. 1        | Fresh daily, staple food                    |\n| Pickaxe                     | 5          | Mining towns, sometimes magical             |\n| Lantern oil (flask)         | 1          | See oil above, but sometimes special blends |\n| Needle & thread             | 0. 5        | Tailors, repairs, sometimes enchanted       |\n| Snares/traps (small game)   | 2          | Hunters, trappers, sometimes illegal        |\n| Local map                   | 5-20       | Hand-drawn, accuracy varies                 |\n| Religious icon              | 1-10       | Local faiths, sometimes magical             |\n| Unusual pet (mouse, lizard) | 1-5        | For children, sometimes magical             |\n| Mystery box                 | 10         | GM's choice, can be a plot hook             |\n\nFor more, see [Thieves Guild General Store Tables](https://www.thievesguild.cc/shops/shop-general), [Rolegenerator Shop Generator](https://www.rolegenerator.com/en/module/shop-generator), and [Jsigvard Tables](https://www.jsigvard.com/dnd/tables.php).\n\n*Tip: Vary inventory by town type and season. A mining town's store will look very different from a coastal village or a trade hub. Use local specialties to inspire side quests or unique interactions.*\n\n---\n\n## 2. Store Layout & Operation\n- **Layout:** Most stores are rectangular, with a counter and a large storeroom. No browsing shelves-customers request items from the clerk.\n- **Hours:** Rural stores open sunrise to sunset; urban stores may have shifts.\n- **Behind the scenes:** Staff buy from locals, restock, do inventory, and keep books outside open hours.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Shopkeeper NPCs\n> \"If you want your players to feel engaged during a shopping session, then you need more than a fun name and an inventory list. You need characters.\"  \n-Ginny Di, [How to make shopping in D&D not suck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kRLCKH6bA8)\n\n- **Quirk + Goal:** Give each shopkeeper a memorable trait and a personal ambition.\n- **NPC Table Example:**\n\n| Name         | Quirk                        | Goal                        | Plot Hook Example                |\n|-------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------|\n| Old Marna    | Always humming old tunes     | Save for grandchild's school| Needs rare book delivered        |\n| Bragg the Bold| Boasts of past adventures   | Sell a cursed artifact      | Hires PCs to recover lost item   |\n| Sella the Stern| Refuses to haggle          | Expand shop to next town    | Needs rare trade permit          |\n\n- **Staff & Regulars:** Add a few recurring employees or customers for depth.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Pricing, Haggling & Cash on Hand\n- **Base prices:** Use PHB/DMG as a starting point; adjust for local scarcity or abundance.\n- **Haggling:** Set a minimum price (shopkeeper's profit margin). Use social checks or roleplay for discounts.\n- **Cash limits:** Small towns may have only 50-200 gp on hand; most wealth is in stock.\n- **Dynamic pricing:** Increase prices during shortages, decrease for bulk sales.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Buy Lists & Adventure Hooks\n- **Buy lists:** Stores may post what they're seeking (e.g., rare herbs, monster parts, local crafts). This can spark side quests.\n- **Example Buy List Table:**\n\n| Wanted Item         | Base Price | Bonus for Quality | Notes                        |\n|--------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------|\n| Giant crab shells   | 10         | +5 if intact      | For fishing town             |\n| Uncut sapphires     | 25         | +50% if flawless  | For mining town              |\n| Healing herbs       | 5          | +2 if fresh       | For rural village            |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Security & Theft Deterrence\n- **Basic:** Locks, barred windows, living quarters attached.\n- **Advanced:** Hired adventurers, guard dogs, magical wards (e.g., Glyph of Warding).\n- **Heist deterrent:** Security NPCs should be 2-3 levels above the party if needed.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Running the Shopping Experience\n- **Roleplay-heavy:** Focus on conversation, upselling, and haggling. NPCs may offer quests or gossip.\n- **Mechanics-heavy:** Players see a list, roll checks to haggle, and buy/sell quickly.\n- **Mix:** Most tables blend both. Adjust to your group's preference.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Making Stores Memorable\n- **Unique items:** Add a few oddities, curios, or homebrew items for flavor. See the tables below for inspiration.\n- **Events:** Store openings, sales, arguments, or even attacks can make shopping sessions dynamic. See the Memorable Shop Events table below.\n- **Consequences:** Theft may trigger magical curses or bring in the law.\n\n---\n\n## 9.
