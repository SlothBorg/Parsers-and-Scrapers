        "content": "# Downtime and Between Adventures\n\nDowntime is one of the most underutilized, yet powerful, aspects of tabletop RPGs. It is the time between adventures when characters pursue personal goals, develop relationships, and shape the world in ways that epic quests rarely allow. This document synthesizes the best advice from Matthew Colville and other veteran GMs, providing actionable techniques, inspiring examples, and multiple approaches to making downtime a highlight of your campaign.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR Checklist: Downtime & Between Adventures\n- [ ] Offer downtime after every major adventure or story arc\n- [ ] Encourage players to invent personal goals and ambitions\n- [ ] Run solo or duo \"side quests\" for players who want them\n- [ ] Use asynchronous play (chat, email, Discord) for downtime scenes\n- [ ] Let downtime actions have real, lasting impact on the campaign\n- [ ] Mix mechanical downtime activities (crafting, training, business) with narrative scenes (politics, relationships, personal quests)\n- [ ] Use downtime to seed new story hooks and complications\n- [ ] Make downtime optional-some players may prefer to skip it\n\n**How to use this checklist:**\nAfter each adventure, invite players to declare what their characters want to do during downtime. Use the checklist to structure your prep and ensure every player has the opportunity to pursue their own story.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What is Downtime?\nDowntime is the period between adventures when characters are not actively questing as a group. It is a chance for:\n- Personal growth and ambition\n- Solo or duo adventures\n- Building relationships, businesses, or strongholds\n- Research, crafting, or training\n- Political intrigue, negotiation, or social climbing\n\n> \"Downtime is an opportunity for your character to pursue their own goals. Which, yes, can sometimes mean getting yourself in over your head, getting in trouble. Those stories are cool too. That is the power of downtime, the power of letting players be self-directed, play asynchronously, meaning we're all playing at different times. And it's something I think is sorely missing from the game these days.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Downtime | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fZWUPxUmYQ)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Approaches to Downtime\n### A. The \"Side Quest\" Model\n- Run short, focused solo or duo sessions for players who want to pursue personal goals.\n- These can be played in person, over chat, or even asynchronously.\n- Let players invent their own ambitions-rescue a loved one, build a business, seek out a mentor, or free a god.\n\n### B. The \"Mini-Game\" Model\n- Use mechanical downtime systems (crafting, training, running a business) as outlined in the DMG or supplements.\n- Roll dice, spend resources, and resolve outcomes quickly.\n- Combine with narrative scenes for best results.\n\n### C. The \"Interlude\" Model\n- Treat downtime as a series of vignettes or interludes-short scenes that develop character, relationships, or world events.\n- Use these to explore backstory, resolve personal arcs, or introduce new NPCs.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Making Downtime Matter\n- Let downtime actions have real consequences-new allies, enemies, or storylines can emerge.\n- Use downtime to reward player creativity and ambition.\n- Allow mistakes and complications; sometimes a personal quest can unleash new threats or plotlines.\n- Share the spotlight: not every player needs a solo adventure, but everyone should have the chance to pursue something meaningful.\n\n> \"Almost all of my players' favorite, most intense experiences in D&D happened in these side quests... The solo adventures are always more personal. We were playing D&D at Pandemic Studios and the players were overwhelmed and had to retreat. One of them, my friend Lara's character, was captured by the necromancer and taken below to be sacrificed. The players were freaked out. They were way too beat up to go rescue her without resting. But if they rested, she was going to die. Wallace messages me the next day at work and he says, 'Hey, it's all like zombies and ghouls down there, right? As far as you know? Well, would they treat me like one of them? Could I get down there and rescue Lara without any of them attacking me?' The trick is, and this is so important, you have to say yes without making it seem like you're saying yes... The idea is theirs, but so must be the decision to do it. That's when things really become extraordinary.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Downtime | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fZWUPxUmYQ)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical Tips for GMs\n- Schedule downtime after every major arc, or whenever the group needs a break\n- Use downtime to introduce new mechanics, locations, or NPCs\n- Encourage players to keep their downtime actions secret for surprise reveals\n- Use downtime to foreshadow future threats or opportunities\n- Allow for both mechanical and narrative downtime activities\n- Be flexible-some players will want deep solo stories, others just a quick roll\n\n---\n\n## 5. Example Downtime Activities\n- Crafting a magic item or researching a spell\n- Training with a mentor or learning a new skill\n- Running a business, guild, or stronghold\n- Political intrigue, negotiation, or social climbing\n- Personal quests: rescuing a loved one, seeking revenge, or fulfilling a vow\n- Building relationships with NPCs or other PCs\n- Recovering from injury, trauma, or loss\n\n---\n\n## 6. Advanced: Asynchronous and One-on-One Play\n- Use chat, email, or Discord to run downtime scenes outside regular sessions\n- Solo or duo play can be more personal and flexible\n- Let players invent their own goals and ambitions-reward initiative\n- Use downtime to deepen character arcs and worldbuilding\n\n---\n\n## 7. Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them\n- Don't force downtime on players who aren't interested\n- Avoid making downtime just a series of die rolls-mix in narrative scenes\n- Make sure downtime actions have real impact on the campaign\n- Don't let downtime drag on-set clear time limits and move the story forward\n\n---\n\n## 8.
