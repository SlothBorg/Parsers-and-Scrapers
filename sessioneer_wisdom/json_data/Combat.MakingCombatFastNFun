Pick the ideas that fit your table and system; most work for any d20 or dice-pool game.\n\n***\n\n## TLDR Checklist\n\nUse during prep or mid-fight troubleshooting.\n\n* [ ] Monsters fight to **live**, not to the death\n* [ ] Enemy HP/AC adapted to session pacing\n* [ ] One-hit minions on field for cinematic flow\n* [ ] Assistant-DM (or initiative tracker) appointed\n* [ ] Players ready: roll attack *and* damage dice together\n* [ ] Battlefield has at least 2 interactive features\n* [ ] Stakes & alternate objectives clear (clock, hostage, lever, etc.)\n* [ ] Telegraph at least one **Battlefield Action** that forces movement & puzzle-thinking (ยง11)\n* [ ] Exit ramps prepared (retreat, surrender, negotiation)\n\nKeep most boxes checked and your combats should hum.\n\n### Using the checklist\n\nBefore the session run through it in \\< 2 minutes.  Mid-fight glance over it if things start dragging-often one quick tweak (drop HP by 25%, trigger an environmental hazard, have foes flee) revives momentum.\n\n***\n\n## 1. Fight to Live, Not to the Death\n\n> \"Surrendering, running away, or calling for help are **more interesting options** than whittling every last HP.\"\n> -Bob World Builder, [How To Make D\\&D Combat Fast & FUN!](https://youtu.be/WnYtiMjljPQ)\n\n* Creatures with morale break when bloodied, faced with overwhelming magic, or after a commander drops.\n* Use contested Intimidation or save vs. Fear to see if they bolt.\n* Escape can open **chase scenes** or future revenge hooks.\n\nPractical tip: mark 40% of a monster's HP as its *morale threshold*. Hit that, start rolling morale.\n\n***\n\n## 2. Tweak the Numbers (On Purpose)\n\nBob's 60-second fix: drop enemy HP & AC, raise their attack bonus.\nWhy it works: fewer whiffs, shorter queues between player turns, same level of danger.\n\nQuick presets (works for most medium monsters):\n\n* Normal pace? 100 % printed HP.\n* Want it **fast?** 65 % HP, -1 AC, +1 attack & damage.\n* Want a pocket **minion?** 1-3 HP, static 5 damage, AC 11.\n\nDon't sweat exact math-adjust live if swingy dice skew the feel.\n\n***\n\n## 3. One-Hit Minions & Cinematic Waves\n\nLow-HP foes that drop in a hit let heavy-hitters feel awesome while keeping the action economy even.\n\nDesign:\n\n* AC 12-14. 1 HP. Flat damage (3-4) or d4.\n* Arrive in waves tied to a timer or story beat (\"doors burst, 4 cultists rush in each round until the bell is smashed\").\n\nReference: Mystic Arts' \"action economy\" primer-more bodies = more actions, so small minions offset solo-monster problems without bogging math.\n\n***\n\n## 4. Delegate: The Assistant DM Trick\n\nDungeon Class' suggestion: hand a willing player monster HP, initiative order, or even the BBEG's stat-block.\n\nBenefits:\n\n* GM brain freed for narration & adjudication.\n* Engaged but over-prepared player gains extra responsibility.\n  Implementation: print the monster stat-block, hand over coloured pencils to mark damage.  Decide privately any secrets or hidden tactics first.\n\n***\n\n## 5. Player-Side Speed Hacks\n\n1. \"Roll attack & damage dice together.\"\n2. Encourage average damage for monsters (PHB lists).\n3. Use static initiative order (e.g., 'PCs clockwise, monsters at 10').\n4. Reward *ready players*: inspiration, hero point, etc.\n\n***\n\n## 6. Interesting Battlefields\n\nGinny Di's research highlights: people move when the *map* demands it.\n\nChecklist for an engaging arena:\n\n* At least two forms of **cover / obstacles** (pillars, wagons, boulders).\n* **Verticality**: balcony, ledge, crane arm.\n* **Change mid-fight**: rising water, spreading fire, collapsing ice.\n* **Multiple entry points** so back-line casters aren't forever safe.\n\nExample: The ruined library. Round 1: dust & books = light cover. Round 3: chandelier crashes, leaving burning difficult terrain and revealing a staircase to upper stacks.\n\n***\n\n## 7. Alternate Win Conditions & Dynamic Clocks\n\nCombat doesn't need to end at **0 HP**. A fresh victory condition instantly rewires tactics, engages under-used mechanics, and slashes dead-rounds off the initiative order.\n\n> \"Most GMs run every battle with *one* win state-kill or be killed.  Change the goal and you change *everything*.\"\n> -Pointy Hat, [D\\&D Combat is Boring (and how to fix it)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzxBSfcHvvg)\n\n### Quick Builder Checklist\n\n* [ ] What *exact* action ends the fight for the PCs?\n* [ ] What ends it for the opposition?\n* [ ] How many rounds until an automatic failure or enemy win? *(3-6 is the sweet spot)*\n* [ ] Is the objective **visible, telegraphed, and interactive** from round 1?\n\n### Four Plug-and-Play Templates\n\n| Template                                  | Win State                                                   | Why It Rocks                                                                                            | Fast Implementation                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **1. Change the Target**                  | First side to drop a *designated creature/object* wins.     | Forces protection play, makes cover, positioning, and tank abilities matter.                            | Give each team a magical mascot (Stat: AC 15, 25 HP). Killing the enemy mascot ends the fight regardless of other combatants.                                                  |\n| **2. The Race / Chase**                   | Reach the finish line or escape zone before the opposition. | Movement, terrain, grapples, *Expeditious Retreat*, trip attacks leap to centre stage.                  | Lay out a 120-ft hallway or canyon map. Both sides start at 0 ft. First model to cross 120 ft triggers victory.                                                                |\n| **3. Style Showdown**                     | Highest *Style Points* when the clock hits 6 rounds.        | Rewards colourful descriptions & varied tactics; great for shy players to practice narration.           | Earn 2 points for unique actions, lose 1 for repeats. Bonus points for crowd-pleasing flourishes. Tiebreaker = remaining HP.                                                   |\n| **4. Bloodsport Ball (Fantasy Football)** | Score X goals before the other team.                        | Encourages teamwork, opens niche spells (Grease, Web) and ranged control; martial PCs shine at tackles. | Add an object (the ball, AC 10, 10 HP). **Action:** Pass (Dex check) or Shoot (Str check). Goal is a 10-ft square 60 ft away. Any normal attack can still knock opponents out. |\n\nFeel free to remix: a *Race* with mascots to protect, or a *Style Showdown* inside a collapsing ritual chamber.\n\n#### Don't Forget the Clock\n\nAlternate goals sing when paired with a **visible timer**:\n\n* Falling portcullis shuts the goal after 4 rounds.\n* Ritual completes on initiative 20 of round 5.\n* Escaping airship leaves the dock in 3 rounds.\n\nClocks create urgency and give slower characters permission to bypass optimal DPR in favour of *doing the thing that matters*.\n\n#### Scaling Difficulty on the Fly\n\n* PCs cruising to victory? Shorten the distance, add a second mascot, or decrease the success threshold.\n* PCs overwhelmed? Reveal a mid-fight shortcut, friendly NPC assist, or extend the timer one round.\n\nInsert one of these variants every few sessions and even veteran groups will lean forward, asking, \"Wait-how do we *win* this one?\"\n\nA pure slug-fest invites slog.  Add a goal that isn't \"reduce HP to 0. \"\n\nOptions:\n\n* Disarm an arcane bomb (6-round countdown)\n* Close three shadow-rifts before demons pour in\n* Protect the envoy until evacuation (10 hit auto-fail)\n* Capture, not kill, for interrogation\n\nUse **3-6 round** clocks so urgency is felt within a typical fight length.\n\n***\n\n## 8. Scaling On The Fly\n\nGinny Di toolkit + Bob tweaks:\n\nIf combat too **easy**:\n\n* Activate hidden power (shield glyph, rage phase).\n* Call reinforcements (costs villain's action).\n* Terrain turns hazardous.\n\nIf too **deadly**:\n\n* Minions flee; boss retreats through secret door.\n* Offer parley (\"Hand over the relic and live.\").\n* Environmental aid: pillar collapses on ogre, dealing 4d10.\n\nKeep changes *visible* so it feels planned, not fudged.\n\n***\n\n## 9. Action Economy (see Action-Oriented Monsters)\n\nFor solo or boss encounters, balance the number of meaningful turns-not raw hit points. The dedicated guide-[Action-Oriented Monsters](Combat.MonsterDesign.ActionOrientedMonsters)-walks through bonus actions, reactions, and villain-action scripting in detail. At minimum, either adopt that framework or add 2-3 low-HP minions so the party isn't taking four turns for every one enemy turn.\n\n***\n\n## 10. Presentation & Energy\n\n* Announce AC occasionally (\"17? You glance off its bone plates!\") so players know hits fast.\n* Use vivid verbs (\"The hobgoblin feints left then cracks its shield into your ribs\").\n* Cue thematic music; fade volume when tension dips.\n* Front-load the session with the fight-energy highest.\n\n***\n\n## 11. Battlefield Actions - Quick Pointer\n\nNeed dramatic telegraphed moves (the \"tell โ player window โ payoff\" loop)? Grab the ready-to-run templates in [Action-Oriented Monsters](Combat.MonsterDesign.ActionOrientedMonsters). Add one every 2-3 rounds to keep people on their toes without bogging the table down.\n\nPointy Hat's video \"[I Made a DnD Combat System & I CAN'T Play Without it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg9BWF7KYqE)\" introduces **Battlefield Actions**-a dead-simple framework for adding MMO-style boss mechanics to tabletop fights.\n\n> \"They make the fight feel, sorry again, *epic*-you're fighting a thing so powerful it has its own rules.\"\n> -Pointy Hat\n\n1. **Tell (End of Boss Turn)** - the creature performs a visible cue.\n2. **Player Window** - PCs have one full round to interpret the tell and respond.\n3. **Resolution (Start of Boss Next Turn)** - if not interrupted/mitigated, the effect fires.\n\nKeep it consistent: *Tell โ Player Window โ Pay-off*.\n\n* **Clarity beats Surprise** - the tell must be obvious enough that players can work it out in one round.\n* **Punish Positioning, Not Existence** - failures should hurt or complicate, not auto-kill.\n* **One at a Time** - run a single Battlefield Action every 2-3 rounds so table bandwidth isn't overwhelmed.\n* **Scale Impact, Not Complexity** - Bigger CR? Widen the blast or spawn tougher adds rather than stacking new rules.\n\nBattlefield Actions slot neatly alongside Legendary & Lair Actions-use whichever combo keeps the table leaning forward.\n\n***\n\n### Recommended Viewing / Reading\n\n* Bob World Builder's [How To Make D\\&D Combat Fast & FUN!](https://youtu.be/WnYtiMjljPQ)\n* Dungeon Class on Assistant DMs (YouTube)\n* Ginny Di, [How to Save a Failing Combat Encounter](https://youtu.be/lEVoOm8a7S8)\n* Mystic Arts, \"But What Even Is the Action Economy?\"\n* Matt Colville, \"Action-Oriented Monsters\"\n\n***\n\nHarness these tools and your combats will speed up, your players will lean in, and you'll still have time for dessert at the end of the session.",
