This page synthesizes the best advice from Matthew Colville, Pointy Hat, Mystic Arts, Bob World Builder, The Fantasy Forge, Trekiros, and more, to help you create dungeons that are fun, memorable, and fit your table's style.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR Dungeon Design Checklist\n- [ ] What is the *theme* and *history* of the dungeon? (Why does it exist? Who built it? What happened here?)\n- [ ] Does the dungeon have a clear *goal* or *purpose* for the players? (Rescue, retrieve, defeat, escape, uncover a secret)\n- [ ] Are there meaningful *choices* and *branching paths*? (Linear, hub-and-spoke, puzzlebox, etc.)\n- [ ] Is resource management (light, food, ammo) relevant to the experience? (Classic crawl vs. narrative focus)\n- [ ] Are there a variety of *encounter types* (combat, traps, puzzles, roleplay)?\n- [ ] Does the dungeon reward *exploration* and *creative problem-solving*? (Secrets, interactables, alternate solutions)\n- [ ] Are the monsters, traps, and puzzles *thematically integrated*? (Do they make sense for the dungeon's story?)\n- [ ] Is there a sense of *progress* (rooms cleared, secrets found, levels descended)?\n- [ ] Does the dungeon have a *memorable climax* and *reward*? (Boss, twist, lore, treasure)\n\n**How to Use This Checklist:**\nUse this as a living reference before and during prep. Don't try to do everything at once-pick the elements that fit your style and campaign. Refer to the cross-linked documents for deep dives on specific techniques.\n\n---\n\n## Types of Dungeons: Ancient vs. Young & Functional\n\nDungeons can be ancient, abandoned places full of mystery and decay, or they can be young, active, and functional. Each type offers unique design challenges and opportunities:\n\n- **Ancient Dungeons:** Characterized by ruin, mystery, and environmental storytelling. Traps and puzzles may be nonsensical or lost to time. Monsters and loot are often scattered and unpredictable.\n- **Young & Functional Dungeons:** In use, organized, and purposeful. Guards, staff, and routines are present. Security is logical, and the layout is efficient. See [Young and Functional Dungeons](DungeonDesign.YoungAndFunctionalDungeons) for a full guide.\n\n> \"When a dungeon is occupied and newly built, it feels very different from an ancient structure. Instead of empty corridors filled with traps, there are likely guards posted who know how the traps work and have to move past them daily.\"  \n> -Master the Dungeon, [How to Make Younger Dungeons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8k72yTZJZk)\n\n---\n\n## 1. What Are Dungeons For? (Philosophy & History)\n> \"A dungeon crawler is, and this may surprise some folks, a kind of survival horror game. ... Your class gives you almost no tools for success. If you want to win, you need this list [of gear] and your wits. Dungeon crawlers challenge the players, not just their character sheets.\"\n> -Matthew Colville, [What Are Dungeons For?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQpnjYS6mnk)\n\n- **Classic Dungeon Crawl:** Early D&D was about survival, resource management, and player ingenuity. Light, food, and ammunition were precious. The dungeon was a hostile, alien place-progress was measured in rooms cleared and loot found.\n- **Modern Approaches:** Today, dungeons can be anything from a single set-piece (the five-room dungeon) to sprawling, multi-level megadungeons. They can focus on narrative, puzzles, combat, or exploration, and can be tailored to any genre or tone.\n- **Bounded Creativity:** Dungeons provide structure and boundaries, making prep manageable and play focused. They are a \"campaign engine\" that can generate weeks of content from a single map.\n\n### The Six Pillars of Dungeon Crawls (Mystic Arts)\nMystic Arts' [Why Dungeon Crawls are the HEART of the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7kuHD71XrA) identifies six fundamental pillars that make dungeon crawls compelling and central to the TTRPG experience:\n\n1. **Arena:** The dungeon is a tactical play space where the stakes are immediate and every choice matters. Entering a dungeon shifts the game from strategic (big-picture) to tactical (moment-to-moment) thinking, engaging players in a different mode and renewing excitement.\n2. **Danger:** Dungeons are the personification of the resource economy. Every encounter, trap, or puzzle drains party resources, making each decision impactful. The challenge is not just to survive an encounter, but to \"win the dungeon\" by managing resources across the whole crawl.\n3. **Resource Management & Time Pressure:** Dungeons are designed to tax player resources-spell slots, hit points, time. Make resting difficult or costly. Use wandering monsters and plot timers (e.g., a ritual in progress) to force players to weigh the value of time versus safety. This creates tension and meaningful obstacles, fueling the narrative arc.\n4. **Vibes & Setting:** Dungeons are not just underground stone corridors. Any contained adventure location-haunted mansion, fey tower, ruined windmill-can be a dungeon. Dungeons force DMs to render the setting in micro-detail, immersing players in the world and making every detail feel significant.\n5. **Constraints:** Dungeons constrain the scope of the narrative, making it easier to manage and prep. The walls, doors, and rooms limit player options, focusing play and making impactful choices more frequent. This reduces GM anxiety and helps keep the game on track.\n6. **Tradition:** Dungeons are a core tradition of the hobby, tapping into the collective memory and nostalgia of TTRPGs. Use this to your advantage-lean into the cultural resonance of dungeons to hook players and make adventures feel important.\n\n> \"Dungeons are the heart of the game. ... They allow your players to constantly make impactful choices.\"  \n> -Mystic Arts, [Why Dungeon Crawls are the HEART of the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7kuHD71XrA)\n\n---\n## 2. Core Dungeon Design Techniques & Structures\n\n### a. Start with Theme & History\n- What was this place *before* it became a dungeon? (Temple, tomb, fortress, laboratory, sunken ship, hidden school wing, etc.)\n- How did it fall into ruin? Who built it, and why? What secrets or tragedies shaped its current state?\n- Layer secrets and environmental storytelling throughout. Use journals, murals, environmental clues, and the placement of objects to tell the story. (The Fantasy Forge)\n\n### b. Define the Goal\n- What do the players need to accomplish? (Rescue, retrieve, defeat, escape, uncover a secret, deactivate a force field, escort an NPC, etc.)\n- Vary goals to keep dungeons fresh. Not every dungeon needs a boss fight at the end. (Pointy Hat)\n\n### c. Structure & Layout: Approaches\n- **Classic Multi-Level Crawl:** Multi-level, interconnected rooms, resource management, and risk/reward decisions. Progress is measured in rooms cleared. (Colville, Gygax)\n- **Five-Room Dungeon:** A compact, story-driven structure. Each \"room\" is a scene or challenge, not necessarily a literal room. (See: [Five Room Dungeon is a Story Structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pB-KR_u15o), Mystic Arts, Bob World Builder)\n- **Theme Park/Hub & Spoke:** Central hub with spokes leading to different challenges or themed regions. Encourages exploration, backtracking, and mastery of the layout. (Trekiros, [Why Disneyland is a great Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVquNM1LyhQ))\n- **Zelda/Metroidvania/Puzzlebox:** The dungeon itself is a puzzle. Progress is gated by keys, items, or knowledge. Backtracking and recontextualization are core. (Bob World Builder, Master the Dungeon)\n- **Branching Paths & Loops:** Offer choices and consequences-let players feel in control. Use purposeful dead ends, shortcuts, and secret doors. (Trekiros, Master the Dungeon)\n\n> \"A path should be purposeful and provide some support to the rest of the dungeon. Even optional paths should hold a reason for existing like housing treasure.\"  \n> -Master the Dungeon, [Designing a Legend of Zelda Inspired Dungeon for D&D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhEr30Bq-zk)\n\n### d. Encounter Variety & Thematic Integration\n- Mix combat, traps, puzzles, and roleplay encounters. (Pointy Hat, Mystic Arts)\n- Design traps and puzzles with purpose-why are they here? Who built them? (Master the Dungeon, Fantasy Forge)\n- Use unique monsters and environmental hazards that fit the dungeon's theme. Avoid generic or out-of-place creatures. (Fantasy Forge)\n- Integrate mechanics with theme: e.g., a dungeon themed around lies uses illusions, perception checks, and NPC deception. (Pointy Hat)\n\n### e. Resource Management, Danger & Tension\n- Dungeons are the ideal arena for resource management. Every spell slot, ability, and hit point spent in one room is unavailable in the next. Make resting difficult or costly-use wandering monsters, plot timers, or environmental hazards to keep the pressure on. (Mystic Arts)\n- Decide if tracking light, food, and ammo is part of the fun (Colville). Classic crawls emphasize scarcity and tension.\n- Use resource scarcity to create tension and drive decision-making. If not, focus on narrative pacing and dramatic stakes.\n- Dungeons are designed to deplete player resources before the climax. (Pointy Hat)\n- Present players with meaningful choices: Is it worth spending a spell slot to open a door, or should the rogue risk time and a wandering monster? Is it better to rush and risk exhaustion, or go slow and risk the plot advancing without them? (Mystic Arts)\n- Make the cost of resting clear-if players can rest, it should come with consequences (e.g., the villain's ritual advances, or monsters reinforce their positions).\n\n### f. Exploration, Interactables & Secrets\n- Highlight 2-4 interactable features in each room (see: [Highlighted Interactables & Exploration Gameplay Loops](Exploration.HighlightedInteractablesNExplorationGameplayLoops)).\n- Reward curiosity and creative problem-solving. Place secrets, hidden doors, and lore in out-of-the-way places. (Colville, Fantasy Forge)\n- Use clues, rumors, and environmental details to hint at secrets. (Secret Doors and Hidden Passages)\n- Render the setting in micro-detail. Every object, mural, or oddity can become significant through play. Let the players' curiosity and willpower turn set dressing into plot hooks. (Mystic Arts)\n- Dungeons are unmatched for immersing players in the setting-use the environment to reinforce the theme and mood of the adventure.\n\n### g. Progress, Pacing & Rewards\n- Make progress visible: rooms cleared, secrets found, levels descended, keys obtained, regions unlocked.\n- Place meaningful rewards: treasure, lore, magic items, or story revelations. (See: [Treasure in Dungeon Design](DungeonDesign.TreasureInDungeonDesign))\n- End with a memorable climax-boss fight, twist, or major discovery. (Mystic Arts, Colville)\n- Use pacing techniques: alternate combat, puzzles, and roleplay to keep things fresh. (Pointy Hat)\n- Mix episodic and serialized storytelling: Each area or session can have its own \"monster of the week\" or theme, while the dungeon as a whole ties into the larger campaign arc. This keeps long dungeons fresh and engaging. (Mystic Arts)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Styles of Dungeon Play\n- **Survival Horror:** Emphasizes scarcity, danger, and player ingenuity (classic crawl).\n- **Narrative/Set-Piece:** Focuses on story beats, character moments, and dramatic pacing (five-room dungeon, theme park).\n- **Puzzlebox/Hub & Spoke:** The dungeon itself is a puzzle to solve, with interconnected rooms and mechanisms (Zelda-style, Trekiros).\n- **Sandbox/Megadungeon:** Open-ended, persistent dungeons with factions, rival parties, and evolving threats.\n\n> \"A majority of a dungeon crawl is trying to solve the dungeon, not fight it. ... Your only tools are this list, a single spell, and your wits.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville\n\n---\n\n## 4. Actionable Dungeon Design Workflow (Step-by-Step)\n1. **Pick a Theme & History:** What is this place? Why does it exist? What happened here? (Fantasy Forge, Colville)\n2. **Define the Goal:** What do the players need to do? (Rescue, retrieve, defeat, escape, uncover a secret, etc.)\n3. **Choose a Structure:** Classic crawl, five-room, hub & spoke, Zelda-style, etc. (See above for structure types)\n4. **Map the Layout:** Sketch levels, areas, and rooms. Use branching paths, loops, and purposeful dead ends. Consider verticality and shortcuts. (Trekiros, Master the Dungeon)\n5. **Populate with Encounters:** Mix combat, traps, puzzles, and roleplay. Make each encounter purposeful, thematic, and varied. Integrate mechanics with theme. (Pointy Hat, Fantasy Forge)\n6. **Layer in Secrets & Rewards:** Hide lore, treasure, and shortcuts for curious players. Use environmental storytelling and clues. (Colville, Secret Doors and Hidden Passages)\n7. **Decide on Resource Management:** Will you track light, food, ammo? Or focus on narrative pacing? (Colville)\n8. **Plan the Climax & Aftermath:** Boss fight, twist, or major discovery. What changes after the dungeon? How does it connect to the wider campaign?\n\n**Pro Tip:** Break large dungeons into manageable chunks. Start with an outline (levels, areas, rooms), then flesh out details as needed. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good-players will enjoy the process of exploring and solving each room, even if you only have a few rooms ready at a time. (Colville)\n\n---\n\n## 5.

This is the secret to finishing very large projects. You just have to break it down into manageable chunks.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [The Dungeon | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVKRUrBDCGc)\n\n- **Levels:** Start with three levels (entrance, living/working quarters, deepest/oldest/villain lair). Each level has a theme and purpose.\n- **Areas:** Each level has 2-3 areas (e.g., guard station, library, kitchens, vault, ritual chamber).\n- **Rooms:** Each area has 2-3 rooms (e.g., scribe's room, bookbinding room, ink storage for a library area).\n- **Flexibility:** Some \"rooms\" can be expanded into areas if you run out of ideas. Not every level/area/room needs to be fully mapped at the start.\n- **Start Small:** For your first session, you only need about five rooms. Expand as needed between sessions.\n\n---\n\n## Example: The Delian Tomb (Colville)\n- **Entrance/Guardian:** Goblin lookouts guard the tomb entrance.\n- **Trap:** Pressure plate scythe trap, only triggered by heavier characters (not goblins/halflings).\n- **Puzzle/Roleplay:** Offering room with a riddle and a pressure plate trap. Oath of the Delian Order inscribed on the wall.\n- **Setback:** Goblin patrols and a boss bugbear with minions.\n- **Secret/Reward:** Hidden room with undead and a magic sword, accessed by solving the riddle or speaking the oath.\n\n---\n\n## Example: Theme-Driven Dungeon (Pointy Hat)\n- **Theme:** Lies/Illusions (Carnival ride, house of mirrors)\n- **Mechanic:** Illusions, perception checks, NPC deception\n- **Goal:** Find the real key among hundreds of illusory keys\n- **Encounters:**\n  - Combat: Hall of mirrors, enemies disguised as illusions\n  - Trap/Puzzle: Room filled with illusory keys, must disable the source\n  - Roleplay: NPC who is not what they seem, hidden motives\n- **Ending:** Boss uses all the mechanics and themes introduced earlier (e.g., splits into illusory copies, players must use knowledge gained to win)\n\n---\n\n## Example: Hub & Spoke / Zelda-Style Dungeon (Trekiros, Bob World Builder, Master the Dungeon)\n- **Central Hub:** Portal console or large chamber with multiple exits\n- **Spokes/Regions:** Each spoke is a themed region (forge, arcane lab, flooded ruins, etc.)\n- **Key Items:** Progression is gated by finding key items or abilities (e.g., magic gloves, crystals, brooches)\n- **Navigation Puzzles:** Players must backtrack, use new items, and solve environmental puzzles to unlock new areas\n- **Bosses:** Each region has a boss or major challenge; defeating them unlocks shortcuts or new abilities\n- **Atmosphere:** Use music, sound cues, and strong themes for each region\n\n---\n",
