        "content": "# Towns and Cities\n\nDesigning towns and cities is about creating living, memorable places that drive adventure and feel real to your players-without overwhelming yourself with prep. This guide synthesizes the best advice from top GMs and worldbuilders, including Matthew Colville, Pointy Hat, Master the Dungeon, The Fantasy Forge, and Bob World Builder.\n\n## TLDR Checklist\n- [ ] Pick a theme or defining feature for the settlement\n- [ ] List key locations (tavern, temple, market, etc.)\n- [ ] Populate with a handful of named NPCs\n- [ ] Draw a simple map (even a sketch)\n- [ ] Add rumors, jobs, or conflicts\n- [ ] Focus on what players can do there (adventures, socializing, shopping, etc.)\n- [ ] Leave space for improvisation and growth\n\n**How to use this checklist:**\nUse it as a session prep tool. Don't try to fill in every detail-just enough to make the town feel alive and ready for play.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Start with a Theme or Identity\n> \"Making your cities highly themed will solve a bunch of the problems... Pick a theme and then replace the X with that theme in the following city: Name, the City of X.\"  \n-Pointy Hat, [The EASY Way to Make D&D Cities Actually Fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCP6UvtBv0U)\n\nA theme (e.g., horses, lights, trade, magic) gives your town or city a unique identity and helps you decide what makes it special.\n\n## 2. List Key Locations\n> \"There are three steps in this process. First, we're going to make a list of all the shops that we can expect to find in the town. Second, we're going to name all the NPCs that live there. And then three, we're going to draw a map.\"  \n-Matthew Colville, [Your First Town | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9capmKmysAE)\n\nTypical locations:\n- Tavern/Inn (often the social hub)\n- Market or general store\n- Blacksmith, healer, stables, temple\n- Unique features (wizard's tower, haunted graveyard, etc.)\n\n## 3. Populate with NPCs\nGive each key location a named NPC (or family). Note their personality, quirks, and relationships. Don't overdo it-just enough to make interactions feel real.\n\n## 4. Draw a Simple Map\nA rough sketch is enough. Place the main features, roads, and any notable terrain (river, hill, etc.).\n\n## 5. Add Dynamic Elements\nInclude job boards, rumors, or ongoing conflicts. These provide adventure hooks and make the town feel alive.\n\n## 6. Focus on Playability\n> \"Striving for realism... is killing you and the game. All of this work just in case someone in the party asks, as if this was like a test... is not leading to something that is fun to play in or fun to explore.\"  \n-Pointy Hat\n\nPrioritize what the players can do in the town. Don't get bogged down in unnecessary detail.\n\n## 7. Expand as Needed\nLet the town or city grow as the campaign progresses. Add new locations, NPCs, and secrets in response to player actions.\n\n---\n\n## Pro Tips & Resources\n- Use the [Donjon Fantasy Town Generator](https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/town) for instant inspiration\n- For city-scale play, divide into districts with unique themes or challenges\n- See [City Builder: Designing Communities](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/63703/city-builder-a-guide-to-designing-communities) for deep dives\n\n---\n\nFor a focused guide on taverns, see [Taverns](WorldBuilding.TownsAndCities.Taverns).\nFor advice on integrating religion and pantheons into your settlements, see [Religion and Pantheons](WorldBuilding.ReligionAndPantheons).\nFor advice on dead empires and lost civilizations, see [Dead Empires and Lost Civilizations](WorldBuilding.DeadEmpiresAndLostCivilizations).\n",
