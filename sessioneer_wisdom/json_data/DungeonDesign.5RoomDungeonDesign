        "content": "# 5 Room Dungeon Design\n\nA practical, multi-perspective guide to the 5 Room Dungeon framework-one of the most popular and effective methods for building short, memorable adventures in tabletop RPGs. This document synthesizes advice from Mystic Arts, Bob World Builder, Matthew Colville, Pointy Hat, and top web resources to help you create engaging, story-driven dungeons that are easy to prep and satisfying to run.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR 5 Room Dungeon Checklist\n- [ ] Entrance/Guardian: Why hasn't this place been looted? Is there an immediate obstacle or foe?\n- [ ] Puzzle/Roleplay Challenge: Is there a non-combat challenge that requires thinking or talking?\n- [ ] Trick/Setback: What twist, trap, or complication disrupts progress?\n- [ ] Climax/Boss: Is there a memorable final encounter or confrontation?\n- [ ] Reward/Revelation: What do the players gain-loot, lore, or a plot hook?\n\n**How to Use This Checklist:**\nUse this as a template for any adventure location-dungeon, mansion, city block, or even a social scenario. Each \"room\" is a scene or challenge, not necessarily a literal room. The structure ensures variety, pacing, and a satisfying arc in a single session.\n\n---\n\n## The 5 Room Dungeon Structure\n\n> \"The five room dungeon isn't just a dungeon with five rooms. It's a structure. Like a story structure. It's an easy way to build your story through a formula that invites creative thinking, but also a way to dissect and understand stories. That's the value of structure if it's both prescriptive and descriptive.\"\n> -Mystic Arts, [The 5 Room Dungeon is a Story Structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pB-KR_u15o)\n\n### 1. Entrance/Guardian\n- Sets the tone and stakes. Why hasn't this place been plundered? Is there a guard, trap, or magical seal?\n- *Example*: Animated statues block the archway; a spectral guardian attacks when the door is touched.\n\n### 2. Puzzle or Roleplay Challenge\n- Requires problem-solving, investigation, or social interaction. Breaks up combat and engages different players.\n- *Example*: A riddle-inscribed altar; a door that opens only with a blood sacrifice; negotiating with goblin minions.\n\n### 3. Trick or Setback\n- A twist, trap, or complication that halts progress or drains resources. Builds tension and tests adaptability.\n- *Example*: A false treasure vault triggers a collapse; a one-way exit forces a detour; hostages are cultists in disguise.\n\n### 4. Climax/Boss Battle\n- The big confrontation-combat, negotiation, or a dramatic challenge. Use all the tactics and themes established so far.\n- *Example*: A necromancer summoning undead; a cult leader mid-ritual; a magical duel in a collapsing chamber.\n\n### 5. Reward, Revelation, or Plot Twist\n- The payoff: treasure, lore, a new hook, or a twist that sets up future adventures.\n- *Example*: A journal revealing the dungeon's tragic history; a secret chamber with loot; a plot twist that ties into the campaign.\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices & Design Tips\n\n| Aspect              | Recommendation                                  |\n|--------------------- | ------------------------------------------------|\n| **Flow**            | Use secret doors or shortcuts for backtracking. |\n| **Pacing**          | Limit to 1-2 encounters per room/scene.         |\n| **Player Agency**   | Offer multiple solutions to challenges.         |\n| **Theming**         | Align traps, monsters, and puzzles with the dungeon's story. |\n| **Scaling**         | Adjust DCs and enemy strength for your party.   |\n\n- **Non-Linear Layouts:** Try hub-and-spoke or branching paths instead of a straight line.\n- **Side Chambers:** Add optional rooms for exploration and immersion.\n- **Scalable Length:** Expand to 6-7 rooms with secret areas or verticality if needed.\n\n> \"Every five room dungeon that I have made and run has been completed in one night. Easy to make, easy to finish. What's not to love?\"  \n> -Mystic Arts\n\n---\n\n## Example: The Delian Tomb (Matthew Colville)\n- **Entrance/Guardian:** Goblin lookouts guard the tomb entrance.\n- **Puzzle/Roleplay:** An offering room with a riddle and a pressure plate trap.\n- **Setback:** A false crypt or a trap that splits the party.\n- **Climax:** Bugbear boss and goblin minions in the main tomb.\n- **Reward/Revelation:** Secret door to the true tomb with undead and a magic sword.\n\n> \"You only need about five rooms. That's about one evening's worth of adventure. Three to four hours.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Your First Adventure | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTD2RZz6mlo)\n\n---\n\n## Flexibility & Advanced Uses\n- **Not Just Dungeons:** Use the 5 Room structure for urban investigations, wilderness journeys, or social intrigue.\n- **Stacking:** Chain multiple 5 Room dungeons for longer adventures or megadungeons.\n- **Rearrange or Combine Steps:** Swap the order, merge rooms, or add extra setbacks for variety.\n- **Apply to Any Genre:** Works for fantasy, sci-fi, horror, or mystery.\n\n---\n\n## Common Pitfalls & Pro Tips\n- **Monotony:** Alternate combat, puzzles, and roleplay to keep things fresh.\n- **Over-Prep:** Use 5-minute templates for rapid iteration ([Roleplaying Tips](https://www.roleplayingtips.com/5-room-dungeons/)).\n- **Player Frustration:** Include at least one \"bailout\" or alternate solution.\n- **Record Unused Ideas:** Save unused rooms or hooks for future adventures.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading & Resources\n- [The 5 Room Dungeon is a Story Structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pB-KR_u15o) (Mystic Arts)\n- [Your First Adventure | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTD2RZz6mlo) (Matthew Colville)\n- [How Long Should An \"Adventure\" Be?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV0Oc_rJs4o) (Bob World Builder)\n- [How to Make GOOD D&D Dungeons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgdBB7D2u6g) (Pointy Hat)\n- [Complete 5-Room Dungeon Template](https://www.roleplayingtips.com/5-room-dungeons/) (Original Method)\n- [Six 5-Room Dungeons for Your Fantasy TTRPG](https://www.highlevelgames.ca/blog/six-five-room-dungeons-for-your-fantasy-ttrpg)\n- [Gygax's GENIUS Dungeon Design Tips | 1975 Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-XmO8r6rzQ) (Bob World Builder)\n\n---\n\n**See also:**\n- [Dungeon Design](DungeonDesign)\n- [Traps](DungeonDesign.Traps)\n- [Encounter Design](Combat.EncounterDesign)\n- [Highlighted Interactables & Exploration Gameplay Loops](Exploration.HighlightedInteractablesNExplorationGameplayLoops)\n",
