        "content": "# Improvisation and On-the-Fly GMing\n\nMastering improvisation is one of the most valuable skills a GM can develop. No matter how much you prep, your players will always surprise you. This guide synthesizes the best advice from Matt Mercer, Bob World Builder, Ginny Di, Satine Phoenix, and more, to help you turn the unexpected into the most memorable moments at your table.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR Checklist\n- [ ] Prepare flexible story threads and NPCs you can drop in anywhere\n- [ ] Take notes during play-write down every improvised detail\n- [ ] Use improv structures: frameworks, bullet points, scatterplots, or a single 'nugget' idea\n- [ ] Let players contribute details-ask them to describe NPCs or locations\n- [ ] Use sensory details to paint scenes on the fly\n- [ ] Don't be afraid to say \"no, but\" or \"yes, but\"-not every idea fits\n- [ ] Recycle unused content for future sessions\n- [ ] Take a break if you need to regroup\n\n**How to use this checklist:**\nBefore each session, prep a few modular elements (NPCs, encounters, rewards). During play, jot down new details as they emerge. When the unexpected happens, reference your toolbox and improvise with confidence.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Improv Mindset: Embrace the Unexpected\n> \"Running any form of role playing game puts you in a position where you become the ringmaster of possibilities... The key is being open to let the players take hold of their own agency and guide the story themselves.\"  \n> -Matt Mercer, [Improv and the Unexpected (GM Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKU2e5Xrx1k)\n\n- Accept that you can't plan for everything. The best stories often come from surprises.\n- View player detours as opportunities, not derailments.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Improv Prep: Build a Toolbox, Not a Script\n- Prepare a handful of NPCs, encounters, and rewards you can drop in anywhere.\n- Keep a list of fantasy names, random plot hooks, and stat blocks handy.\n- Develop side plots or rumors that can connect back to your main story if needed.\n- Recycle unused content for future sessions.\n\n**Example:** Matt Mercer suggests having a cache of colorful NPCs and a few stat cards for common folk or monsters, ready to be used at a moment's notice.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Improv Structures: Frameworks, Bullet Points, Scatterplots, and Nuggets\n> \"Most of D&D is improv. We make it up as we go... But you can prepare yourself with a framework, bullet points, a scatterplot, or just a single nugget idea.\"  \n> -Bob World Builder, [IMPROV Tips For Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAUIptSpkO4)\n\n- **Framework:** A mind map of interconnected plot points, NPCs, and locations.\n- **Bullet Points:** A linear list of key beats or scenes.\n- **Scatterplot:** A page of unconnected ideas (NPCs, secrets, locations) that players can link together.\n- **Nugget:** One central idea or hook that everything else can branch from.\n\nChoose the structure that fits your style and the session's needs.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Collaborative Improvisation: Let Players Help\n- Ask players to describe details: \"What does the innkeeper look like?\"\n- Use their ideas to build the world and share the creative load.\n- This keeps everyone engaged and can spark new directions.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Sensory Details: Paint the Scene\n- When improvising a new location, describe what the characters see, hear, smell, and feel.\n- Trust your instincts-let the details emerge naturally.\n\n---\n\n## 6. The \"Yes, And\" (and Beyond) Principle\n> \"Yes, and is helpful, but not every situation is a yes and situation... Use the 'yes, and', 'yes, but', 'no, and', and 'no, but' grid to respond to player ideas.\"  \n> -Ginny Di, [\"Yes, and\" isn't the great D&D advice you think it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDt2Z_1Pe9w)\n\n- Use \"yes, and\" to encourage creativity, but don't be afraid to say \"no, but\" or \"yes, but\" to maintain game balance and world logic.\n- Always provide context for your decisions-explain why something is or isn't possible.\n\n### The YAB Grid: A Practical Tool for Saying Yes and No\n\nGinny Di proposes a four-quadrant approach to improvisational responses:\n\n- **Yes, and...**: The player can do the thing, and something extra is true. (\"Yes, and the main ingredient is a flower you've seen growing nearby.\")\n- **Yes, but...**: The player can do the thing, but there's a complication or limitation. (\"Yes, but the king's goblet is close to the advisor's, so you'll need to roll to pick the right one.\")\n- **No, and...**: The player can't do the thing, and there's a reason or new information. (\"No, and the advisor doesn't have a goblet tonight-he's keeping his head clear.\")\n- **No, but...**: The player can't do the thing as described, but there's an alternative or a lead. (\"No, but you see a servant preparing soup bowls for the head table, which could be accessed without being seen.\")\n\n> \"Anytime you're faced with a situation you didn't anticipate, start with two decisions: Is this possible? That's the yes or no. Then you either explain why with an 'and,' or introduce new information with a 'but.' Either way, you're giving your players context for your call.\"  \n> -Ginny Di, [\"Yes, and\" isn't the great D&D advice you think it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDt2Z_1Pe9w)\n\n- Use **No, and** sparingly, as it fully shuts down a player's idea. Prefer **No, but** to keep the story moving and offer new avenues.\n- Remember: Your job is to arbitrate the world, not just to say yes to everything. Sometimes, saying no is necessary to maintain tone, genre, or world logic.\n- When you say no, always provide information that helps the player understand the world better, so their next idea is more informed.\n\n### Example: Handling Player Requests\n- Player: \"Can I sneak poison into the advisor's wine?\"\n  - Yes, and: \"All eyes are on the king, making it a perfect opportunity.\"\n  - Yes, but: \"The goblets are close together; roll to see if you pick the right one.\"\n  - No, and: \"The advisor doesn't have a goblet tonight.\"\n  - No, but: \"You see a servant with soup bowls you could access.\"\n\nFor more, see Ginny Di's [\"Yes, and\" isn't the great D&D advice you think it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDt2Z_1Pe9w) and Master the Dungeon's [Saying Yes and No to Your D&D Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVcR0jECxcM).\n\n---\n\n#### See also: [Saying Yes and No to Your D&D Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVcR0jECxcM) for more examples and philosophy on balancing player agency and DM authority.\n---\n\n## 7. Saying Yes and No: Balancing Player Agency and DM Authority\n\n> \"As a dungeon master, this means running the game and having to wrest some of that power away from your players. There are times when your players may want to do crazy things. There are times when the mundane things they do go awry. While you're the one describing the narrative, they are the ones driving it. To keep this a happy balance, you need to understand how and when to say yes and no to your players.\"  \n> -Master the Dungeon, [Saying Yes and No to Your D&D Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVcR0jECxcM)\n\n### Best Practices for Saying Yes\n- Avoid railroading; let your group explore and get off track.\n- Saying yes doesn't always mean literally saying \"yes.\" Instead, open up possibilities through the world:\n  - \"You see a guard atop the gate tower. You might be able to ask.\"\n  - \"The inn looks busy, but you notice several keys still hang on hooks behind the counter.\"\n- Use narrative cues to indicate what is possible, priming players for interaction and roleplay.\n- Often, you're really saying \"maybe\"-the world, not the DM, provides the answer.\n\n### Best Practices for Saying No\n- Avoid outright \"no\" unless necessary. Instead, narrate why something is difficult or impossible:\n  - \"You look for areas to gain purchase, but the rock is too smooth and slick.\"\n- Let players try anyway-creativity, spells, and tools can sometimes overcome obstacles.\n- If players persist, introduce consequences (alerting guards, triggering a fall), but use this sparingly and always warn players of risks.\n- If players insist on rolling, let them-then narrate failure, even on a high roll, if the action is truly impossible.\n- When all else fails, be direct: sometimes you just need to say no to protect the game, tone, or world logic.\n\n> \"Yes and no are essentially your most powerful tools that you have as a DM. Since you get to decide, use them wisely.\"  \n> -Master the Dungeon, [Saying Yes and No to Your D&D Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVcR0jECxcM)\n\n### When to Use Each Approach\n- Use \"yes\" to encourage exploration and creativity, but always within the logic of your world.\n- Use \"no\" to protect the tone, genre, or internal consistency of your setting, or to prevent game-breaking actions.\n- Always provide context and alternatives when possible.\n\n#### See also: Matthew Colville's [\"No.\" | Running The Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6St9pH4-16E) for a deep dive on when and why to say no, and how to do so without shutting down player fun.\n\n---\n\n> \"If you're thrown for a loop, take a break. Let the players plan while you regroup. Listen to their ideas-they'll often tell you what they want to see next.\"  \n> -Satine Phoenix, [When Stories Derail! (GM Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2euH1sQugQg)\n\n- Don't panic. Take a short break to gather your thoughts.\n- Let players discuss their plans; use their ideas to guide your next move.\n\n---\n\n## 8. When Subtlety Fails: The Direct No\n\n- If subtle narrative cues and consequences don't deter players from impossible or disruptive actions, be clear and direct.\n- Explain your reasoning: Is it about world logic, tone, or the integrity of your setting?\n- Remember, D&D is a shared experience-sometimes, you must protect the game for everyone at the table.\n- Use the direct \"no\" sparingly, but don't be afraid to use it when necessary.\n\n> \"If the subtlety of saying no doesn't convince your players, you shouldn't consider it a failure. Dungeons and Dragons is a shared experience. Unfortunately, sometimes your players refuse to share with you. The game relies on all table members working together. When either you or your players try to brute force an outcome, you're hurting the game for everyone else.\"  \n> -Master the Dungeon, [Saying Yes and No to Your D&D Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVcR0jECxcM)\n\n---\n\n## 9. Reskin and Recycle\n- If players skip content, move it to where they're going.\n- Change the context of encounters or NPCs to fit the new direction.\n- Nothing is wasted-just repurposed.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Note-Taking: Your Best Friend\n- Write down every improvised name, plot hook, or NPC detail as soon as it comes up.\n- Review and flesh out these notes between sessions.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Final Advice: Have Fun, Be Forgiving, and Embrace Imperfection\n> \"At the end of the day, it's just a game. Be forgiving to yourself. Every session is a learning experience for a GM.\"  \n> -Nerdarchy, [Off-The-Cuff Home Brew Games (GM Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztH7NtxVl2M)\n\n- Don't stress about perfection. The goal is fun and shared storytelling.\n- Improv is a skill-practice makes it easier.\n- The more sessions you run, the better you get. There is no substitute for experience. \"You only get GM XP from actually running the game... If you never run and just spend all your time prepping, you never gain the XP.\"  \n> -Mystic Arts, [No, Quality is not better than Quantity!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjC5eTndCqg)\n- Embrace your imperfections and run the game anyway. Each session is a rep that makes you a better GM.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading & Resources\n- Matt Mercer: [Improv and the Unexpected (GM Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKU2e5Xrx1k)\n- Bob World Builder: [IMPROV Tips For Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAUIptSpkO4)\n- Ginny Di: [\"Yes, and\" isn't the great D&D advice you think it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDt2Z_1Pe9w)\n- Satine Phoenix: [When Stories Derail!
