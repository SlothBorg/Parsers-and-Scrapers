        "content": "# Traps\n\nA practical, multi-perspective guide to designing and running traps in tabletop RPGs. This document synthesizes advice from Matthew Colville, Master the Dungeon, The Fantasy Forge, and top web resources to help you create traps that are memorable, purposeful, and fun for your table.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR Trap Design & Use Checklist\n- [ ] Does the trap have a clear *purpose* in the dungeon's story or ecology?\n- [ ] Is the *trigger* fair, telegraphed, and thematically appropriate?\n- [ ] Are there *multiple ways* to detect, avoid, or disarm the trap?\n- [ ] Does the trap create *meaningful decisions* or consequences for the players?\n- [ ] Is the trap's effect more than just hit point loss (resource drain, split party, narrative twist)?\n- [ ] Is the trap integrated with the environment, monsters, or story?\n- [ ] Are the consequences immediate, long-lasting, or narrative?\n- [ ] Is the trap's danger level appropriate for the party?\n\n**How to Use This Checklist:**\nUse this before placing a trap in your dungeon. If you can't check most boxes, consider redesigning the trap or using a different obstacle.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Role of Traps in Play\n> \"Traps occupy this weird space in the game. Unlike fighting monsters, traps aren't really part of the game in any significant way... The rules don't present traps as a real feature. There's not much to interact with.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Traps!, Running The Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwj9M4qVafE)\n\n- Traps are *boutique content*: Each is unique, often requiring bespoke rulings and improvisation.\n- They are not meant to be the main event, but to break up monotony, reinforce the dungeon's history, and create decision points.\n- Good traps create *memorable moments*-not just resource tax.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Trap Purposes & Types\n**Why is this trap here?**\n- **Test Caution:** Remind players the world is dangerous (e.g., pressure plate scythe in the Delian Tomb).\n- **Raise Tension:** Add drama or a ticking clock to a scenario (e.g., pit trap during a stealth infiltration).\n- **Split the Party:** Change encounter dynamics, limit resources, or create tactical challenges (e.g., portcullis trap that divides the group before a monster attack).\n- **Standalone Encounter:** Some traps are entire encounters, combining monsters, puzzles, and hazards (e.g., Rube Goldberg-style trap corridors).\n- **Resource Drain:** Weaken the party before a major fight, forcing hard choices about healing, resting, or pressing on.\n- **Narrative Device:** Reveal lore, history, or foreshadowing through the trap's design or consequences.\n\n### MonarchsFactory's Trap Philosophy: Team Us vs Team Them\n> \"A trap is inherently a game of us and them. Either you're on the side of the trap, you're in the know, maybe you made the trap yourself, or you're on team them, which is everyone else. Because they're in the know, Team Us is almost always safe from the trap's effect. Team Them, who will in most cases be your player party, have the task of convincing the trap that they're actually not team them, they're team us. Because a trap should be dumb. It can't actually actively tell the difference between team us and team them, except for within the specific parameters of the trigger.\"  \n> -Dael Kingsmill, MonarchsFactory's [Traps that Make Sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXZXSYjlnGE)\n\n#### Three Core Trap Purposes (per Dael Kingsmill):\n- **Lock and Key:** Only those with the right knowledge or item (the 'key') can bypass the trap. If you know the song to play for the three-headed dog, you pass; if not, you don't. Riddles as passwords often make less sense than simple keys. *Example: Hagrid's Fluffy in Harry Potter, where only the right song puts the dog to sleep. By contrast, Snape's logic puzzle is a fun puzzle but a terrible lock, because the creator would never need a riddle to access their own secret.*\n- **Trap Proper:** Like a rabbit snare or bear trap, these are designed to catch or harm anyone who doesn't know to avoid them. Team Us knows where the trap is and how to avoid it; Team Them doesn't. *Example: Egyptian tombs with false tunnels and pit traps-Team Us knows the real entrance, Team Them falls for the decoy.*\n- **Trial of the Worthy:** These are challenges meant to test worthiness, not just knowledge. The trigger for 'us' vs 'them' is more abstract-only someone 'worthy' (brave, clever, etc.) can pass. *Example: The leap of faith in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, where only those willing to leap can cross.*\n\n> \"The penalty must fit the purpose. On a practical level, that usually means that a trap should kill, keep out, or capture the person who is team them.\"  \n> -Dael Kingsmill\n\n**Design Tip:**\n- Always ask: Who is Team Us? Who is Team Them? What is the trap's purpose, and does the penalty fit that purpose?\n- Be wary of traps that don't make sense for their creators (e.g., why would Snape leave a logic puzzle for his own lock?).\n- *If a trap is meant to keep people out, a broken lockpick is a fitting penalty. If it's meant to kill, the effect should be deadly. If it's a trial of the worthy, failure should have meaningful consequences, not just minor damage.*\n\n#### Narrative Purpose & Player Experience\n- **Work Backwards:** Start by asking, \"How do I want my players to feel?\"-then design the trap to create that feeling. (MonarchsFactory)\n- **Traps as Storytelling:** Beating a trap should reveal something about its creator (Team Us). A simple lockpick-breaking trap suggests a law-abiding, non-vicious owner; a goblin alarm trap reveals a culture that enjoys hunting and psychological warfare.\n- **Use Traps to Set Tone:** Want to instill paranoia? Use silent alarm traps (e.g., spy syndicate tripwire that triggers nothing obvious, but puts players on edge). Want to awe? Use dramatic magical effects. Want to frustrate? Use resource-draining traps.\n- **Critical Role Example:** The Sunken Tomb glyph trap instantly killed a character, fitting the narrative of a tomb meant to keep its secrets at all costs. The penalty matched the purpose-no half-measures.\n\n#### Traps vs. Puzzles\n- **Traps and puzzles are not the same.** Logic puzzles as locks rarely make sense-why would the creator need a riddle to access their own secrets? Use puzzles for fun, but don't confuse them with practical security.\n\n> \"For me, traps and puzzles shouldn't be the same thing. Puzzles are great, but a trap should make sense for its creator and purpose.\"  \n> -Dael Kingsmill\n\n---\n\n## 3. Core Trap Design Principles\n### a. Purpose-Driven Design\n- Every trap should have a reason for existing-who built it, and why?\n- Traps should fit the dungeon's theme, history, and the resources of its creators. (The Fantasy Forge)\n\n### b. Fair Triggers & Telegraphed Danger\n- Triggers should be clear and fair: pressure plates, tripwires, magical glyphs, etc.\n- Use environmental clues: scorch marks, disturbed dust, or suspicious mechanisms.\n- Players should feel \"we should have seen that coming\" rather than \"that was unfair.\" (The Fantasy Forge)\n\n### c. Multiple Solutions\n- Allow for detection (Perception/Investigation), avoidance (Acrobatics/creative play), disarmament (tools, spells), or simply enduring the effect.\n- Passive perception can help avoid \"I check for traps every 5 feet\" syndrome. (Master the Dungeon)\n\n### d. Consequences Beyond Damage\n- Immediate: Damage, conditions, or movement (e.g., pit, net, immobilization).\n- Long-lasting: Curses, poison, resource drain, or altered party composition.\n- Narrative: Triggering story events, releasing monsters, or revealing secrets.\n\n### e. Integration with Encounters\n- Combine traps with monster tactics (e.g., bugbears attacking after a portcullis drops).\n- Use traps to alter the battlefield, create hazards, or force movement.\n\n### f. Creativity & Subversion\n- Subvert expectations: Obvious traps may hide more dangerous, less obvious ones (parallel traps).\n- Use lures, chase mechanics, or environmental hazards to create dynamic scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Running Traps at the Table\n- **Describe clues and consequences clearly.**\n- **Fail forward:** A failed disarm might trigger a partial effect or escalate the situation, not just \"nothing happens.\"\n- **Avoid save-or-die:** Traps should rarely kill outright; instead, they should create problems to solve.\n- **Layer traps sparingly:** Parallel or multi-stage traps can be memorable, but overuse breeds paranoia.\n- **Reward creative solutions:** Let players use spells, tools, or clever ideas to bypass or repurpose traps.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Advanced Trap Techniques\n- **Traps as Player Tools:** Consider letting players set or repurpose traps (e.g., \"traps in a bottle\"-magical oils that create temporary traps). (Master the Dungeon)\n- **Moving Traps:** Use traps that move or relocate players, not just harm them (pit to cell, teleporters, labyrinths).\n- **Chase & Lure Traps:** Use treasure or fleeing monsters to lure players into danger or new areas.\n- **Obvious vs. Unexpected:** Play with player expectations-sometimes the real danger is hidden behind the obvious threat.\n\n---\n\n## 7.
