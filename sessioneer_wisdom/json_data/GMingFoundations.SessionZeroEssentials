        "content": "# Session Zero Essentials\nEnsuring every campaign starts on the same page.\n\nSession Zero is the single most cost-effective hour you can spend as a Game Master.  Done well it prevents 80 % of the problems that clog GM sub-reddits later (\"My DM nerfed my class!\", \"Scheduling is a nightmare...\", \"We hate PvP but Bob keeps back-stabbing\").  \n\nThis document distills common best-practice from several veteran creators-Ginny Di, Bob World Builder, The Fantasy Forge, and Stephanie Plays Games-into an actionable template you can copy-paste for any system.\n\n---\n## TLDR 15-Point Checklist\nUse this as your agenda.  Print it; tick the boxes.\n\n1. ☐ Ice-breaker/team-building round (name, favourite RPG moment, one player strength)  \n2. ☐ Confirm *campaign pitch* & tone (genre, themes, expected length)  \n3. ☐ Schedule: session frequency, duration, location/VTT, cancellation policy  \n4. ☐ Communication channel chosen (Discord? e-mail?)  \n5. ☐ Table etiquette (phones, food, alcohol, rules look-ups)  \n6. ☐ Lines & Veils / safety tool collected & shared  \n7. ☐ Rules expectations (RAW vs RAI, veto power, how to dispute)  \n8. ☐ House-rules listed & *why* they exist  \n9. ☐ Character creation parameters (level, sourcebooks, stat method, restrictions)  \n10. ☐ Party cohesion exercise (shared origin or goal)  \n11. ☐ Back-story guidelines (length, dangling hooks, no locked secrets without consent)  \n12. ☐ Level-up & advancement procedure (milestone? XP? downtime?)  \n13. ☐ Absent-player plan (play on, sidekick, skip?)  \n14. ☐ Campaign framework brainstorm (what % Combat / Exploration / RP?)  \n15. ☐ Next steps & homework (finalise characters, join Discord, date of Session 1)\n\n*How to use it*:  Run top-to-bottom.  If time is short hit the bolded essentials (2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 11).\n\n---\n## 1.  Why Bother?\n> \"Half the problems I see online could have been prevented by a Session Zero.\"  \n> -Ginny Di, *[Do THIS before starting your D&D campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm_TS9pge7o)*\n\n- Sets *expectations* before anyone invests months of emotion.  \n- Surfaces deal-breakers early (\"I hate horror\", \"I only play evil rogues\").  \n- Gives you free plot seeds-mine player backstories and preferences.\n\nThe Fantasy Forge boils it down to three reasons: 1) Align DM & player goals, 2) Test group chemistry, 3) Establish boundaries.\n\n---\n## 2.  Warm-Up: Team > Characters\nBob World Builder starts every Session Zero with a 3-question ice-breaker:\n1. Something you love about RPGs  \n2. Which pillar excites you most-Combat, Exploration/Puzzles, or Role-play?  \n3. One strength you bring to the table \n\nThis takes five minutes and instantly tells you how to weight the campaign.\n\n---\n## 3.  The Big Three Conversations\nGinny Di summarises Tasha's Cauldron into three buckets.  They map neatly onto your checklist:\n\n1️⃣ Character & Party Creation  \n2️⃣ Social Contract  \n3️⃣ Game Customisation (house-rules, tone, safety)\n\nBelow is a menu for each-pick what your table needs.\n\n### 3. 1 Character & Party Creation\n- Starting level, ability-score method, allowed books  \n- Guard-rails: thematically banned options *with justification* (\"Gnomes are extinct in this setting\" > \"I think gnomes are annoying\").  \n- Cohesion prompt: roll or choose a pre-existing relationship (Tasha's table or make your own).  \n- Session-Zero character build: new players often appreciate building together on screen.\n\n### 3. 2 Social Contract\nConcrete beats abstract.  Ask and record:\n- Tardiness: how long do we wait?  \n- Missing players: side-kick, fade-out, cancel?  \n- PvP yes/no; stealing from party; romance at the table  \n- Device & snack policy  \n\nStephanie Plays Games recommends a **Pre-Campaign Survey** so you arrive already knowing hot-button issues.\n\n### 3. 3 Safety Tools (Lines & Veils)\n> \"These limits aren't just for sensitive players-they're for everyone.\" -Ginny Di\n\nMethods:  anonymous Google Form, index cards, or the X-card at the table.  Compile a single list (no names) and share it.  Revisit mid-campaign.\n\n---\n## 4.  House-Rules & Homebrew\nWhen you change RAW, answer *why*.  If it doesn't fix a problem or add fun, cut it.  (See Ginny Di's *[How to choose house rules that won't break your game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yl-hP_1oA8)*.)  Limit yourself to 3-5 at a time; add more only after play-testing.\n\nTemplate to announce a rule:\n> **Rule**: Potions are a bonus-action to drink.  \n> **Why**: Speeds up combat so everyone gets more turns.\n\n---\n## 5.  Scheduling-Campaign Killer #1\nBob World Builder calls irregular scheduling \"the #1 campaign killer\".  Nail down:\n- Regular slot (e.g., \"every other Thursday 7-10 PM\")  \n- How many skips allowed per quarter  \n- Holiday protocol  \n- Primary comms channel\n\n---\n## 6.  Mining Player Gold\nStephanie's \"evil DM market research\" perspective:  listen for *repeated excitement*.  If three players light up when someone mentions sky-pirates, write \"sky-pirates\" in bold on your prep sheet.  Those hooks practically write your adventure path.\n\nPro-tip: after Session Zero send each player a **Back-story Questionnaire** (name one NPC ally, one rival, one unresolved problem).  Instant side-quests.\n\n---\n## 7.  Bringing It Together-Three Intensity Models\nAdapt the workload to your table:\n\n- **I Read Your Backstory** - light-touch Easter eggs, works for one-shots.  \n- **Ensemble Episodes** - each PC gets a spotlight side-quest (à la TV shows).  \n- **The Party *is* the Plot** - weave backstories into the core arc; best for long campaigns, high prep.\n\n(Concept from Ginny Di *[I'm begging you to use your players' backstories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYf2pTnkFtk)*.)\n\n---\n## 8.  Example Agenda (110 min)\n| Time | Activity |\n|------ | ----------|\n| 0-10 | Ice-breaker round |\n| 10-25 | Campaign pitch & tone discussion |\n| 25-45 | Scheduling + social contract |\n| 45-60 | Lines & Veils collection (private forms) |\n| 60-80 | Character parameters & party origin brainstorm |\n| 80-95 | House-rules overview & Q&A |\n| 95-105 | Next-steps, homework, set Session 1 date |\n| 105-110 | Quick feedback round (\"What excites you most?\") |\n\nFinish while energy is high so players leave *pumped*, not drained (Ginny Di's vibe advice).\n\n---\n## 9.  Troubleshooting\n| Issue | Fix |\n|------- | -----|\n| Player monopolises discussion | Use a *talking token* or timebox each answer. |\n| Nobody has character ideas | Bring random ancestry/class prompt cards; offer pregens. |\n| Safety limits cause GM panic (\"my horror game!\") | Discuss tone adjustments or choose different module; don't spring content on players. |\n| Chronic scheduler | Rotate to asynchronous West-Marches style or rule that game proceeds with ≥ 3 players. |\n\n---\n## 10.
