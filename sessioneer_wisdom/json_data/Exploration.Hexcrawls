        "content": "# Hexcrawls\n\nA practical guide to running engaging hex-based exploration in tabletop RPGs, synthesizing advice from Mystic Arts, Bob World Builder, and others.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR: Hexcrawl Best Practices\n- [ ] Use small hexes (e.g., 3 miles/1 league) for informed choices\n- [ ] Let players see into adjacent hexes-describe visible features, landmarks, or rumors\n- [ ] Populate hexes with meaningful locations, secrets, and discoveries\n- [ ] Make each discovery reveal new clues, plot hooks, or connections\n- [ ] Use random encounters sparingly and ensure they add to the story\n- [ ] Allow downtime and roleplay during travel (crafting, campfire scenes, etc.)\n- [ ] Present choices that matter-avoid arbitrary or uninformed decisions\n\n**How to Use This Checklist:**\nWhen prepping a hexcrawl, focus on what players can see, learn, and choose. Make each hex a potential source of discovery, not just a blank space.\n\n---\n\n## What is a Hexcrawl?\nA hexcrawl is a method of overland exploration where the map is divided into hexes, each representing a set distance (often 3 miles). Players move from hex to hex, discovering new locations, secrets, and challenges as they go.\n\n> \"Hexcrawls become boring when the choices are arbitrary. For a game to be a game, you need to be making informed decisions, and your decisions can't be informed if you don't know what's in a hex before you enter it.\"  \n> -Mystic Arts, [Why 3-mile hexes make HEXCRAWLS fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEIg1DlRkLg)\n\n---\n\n## Key Principles\n- **Informed Choices:** Let players see or hear about features in adjacent hexes. Use rumors, visible landmarks, or clues to guide decisions.\n- **Discovery & Clues:** Each discovery should reveal more about the world-clues to dungeons, factions, or secrets in nearby hexes.\n- **Game-Like Structure:** Treat exploration as a game with clear options, risks, and rewards. Use the [Highlighted Interactables & Exploration Gameplay Loops](Exploration.HighlightedInteractablesNExplorationGameplayLoops) technique to make each location interactive and engaging. Use resource management (food, time, etc.) if it adds tension, but don't let it bog down play.\n- **Downtime & Roleplay:** Allow for campfire scenes, crafting, and character moments during travel. Use watches and night scenes for roleplay and worldbuilding.\n- **Random Encounters:** Use as inspiration, not filler. Encounters should reveal something about the world, foreshadow threats, or tie into ongoing stories.\n- **Vista Points:** Let players climb hills or towers to see further, revealing more of the map and new options.\n- **Secrets & Hidden Content:** Some hexes may have hidden features only found by searching or following clues.\n\n---\n\n## Example: Running a Hexcrawl\n- Players move into a new hex (3 miles)\n- Describe what they see in adjacent hexes (bog, road, ruins, etc.)\n- Present choices: which direction to go, whether to investigate a visible landmark, or search for hidden features\n- When a location is discovered, provide clues to other nearby secrets or plot hooks\n- Allow downtime activities and roleplay during camp\n\n---\n\n## Integrating Other GM Wisdom\n- **Bob World Builder:** Seed plot hooks and lore in discoveries; let players help shape the world through their choices\n- **Mystic Arts:** Use hexcrawls to gamify exploration-make each choice meaningful and each discovery rewarding\n- **Matthew Colville:** Use hexes to structure travel, but skip or fast-forward if nothing meaningful is likely to happen\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading & References\n- [Exploration](Exploration) - Core principles, types, and best practices for all exploration\n- [Point Crawl](Exploration.PointCrawl) - For node-based, city, or planar exploration\n- [Urban Exploration](Exploration.UrbanExploration) - For city-based adventures and node-based play\n- [Highlighted Interactables & Exploration Gameplay Loops](Exploration.HighlightedInteractablesNExplorationGameplayLoops) - For making each location interactive and engaging\n- Mystic Arts' [Why 3-mile hexes make HEXCRAWLS fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEIg1DlRkLg)\n- Bob World Builder's [The Best PREP Strategy for Dungeon Masters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgyXPpUK-nQ)\n- [Travel Event Systems (Pointy Hat Method and Beyond)](Exploration.TravelEventSystemsPointyHatMethodAndBeyond)\n",
