The goal is to create a gameplay loop: highlight, invite investigation, reveal new details, and repeat. This keeps players engaged and makes exploration feel like a game, not a chore.\n\n---\n\n## The \"Highlight Interactables\" Technique (Mystic Arts)\n> \"In Baldur's Gate 3 when you hover your cursor over an interactable, it becomes highlighted in white outlines to tell you that you can click on it and by extension that clicking on it does something. You have to find that out for yourself. In most adventure games, when you approach an object you can interact with, there is text in the upper right hand corner that says Press X to use the telephone or whatever-you can do that. You can tell your players the RPG equivalent of Press X to play the game. Only, you know, be a little bit more subtle, but not a lot more subtle.\"  \n-Mystic Arts, [Make Exploration into a Game to Hook Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4Tu2zzDU3I)\n\n### How to Do It:\n- **Describe 2-4 interesting features** in the scene (e.g., a cracked skylight, a table with strange candles, a bookshelf with scrolls).\n- **Don't explain everything**-just enough to spark curiosity.\n- **Wait for players to pick an option**-then provide more detail, which may reveal new interactables or small problems to solve.\n- **Nest options**: If a player investigates a table, describe drawers; if they open a drawer, describe what's inside, and so on.\n- **If a location is empty**, describe its emptiness clearly and move on quickly.\n\n### Example: The Library Scene\n> \"As you push the door open, you see a massive library with tall bookshelves lining the walls. There is a cracked skylight filtering in gentle rays of dusty sunlight, revealing more of what lies within. You notice a bookshelf just 20ft away from you with a series of scrolls, and in the center of the room there is a table with a strange arrangement of candles.\"\n\nPlayers now have clear options: skylight, scrolls, candles. When they investigate, reveal more details and new choices, keeping the loop going.\n\n---\n\n## The Exploration Gameplay Loop\n1. **Highlight Interactables**: Present 2-4 options in your description.\n2. **Invite Investigation**: Wait for players to choose what to examine.\n3. **Reveal New Details**: Give more information, possibly new interactables or a small problem/obstacle.\n4. **Spark Creative Problem-Solving**: Let players use abilities, skills, or teamwork to overcome obstacles.\n5. **Repeat**: As new details emerge, repeat the loop or move to the next scene.\n\n> \"Each step involves a simple problem. Then the players quickly solve the problem, which then involves another problem. This continues until the scene is done. Each problem is just a small hurdle. You see, it's a little game of exploration and the players can play along. This isn't a puzzle. The problems aren't massive, they aren't stopping play for hours. They're just small games, though not in a mechanical sense, not in any sort of number-crunchy meaning of the word. Just small moments that invite creative thinking as they explore the library.\"  \n-Mystic Arts, [Make Exploration into a Game to Hook Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4Tu2zzDU3I)\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices & Pitfalls\n- **Don't overload with options**: 3 is a good number; 2 or 4 is fine. Too many, and players get lost; too few, and it feels railroaded.\n- **If only one option exists**, make it complex and mysterious enough to invite deep investigation.\n- **Nest interactables**: Let each investigation reveal more options, not just answers.\n- **Cut between players**: As one group investigates, cut to another to keep everyone engaged.\n- **Communicate emptiness**: If a room is empty, say so clearly and move on-don't waste time searching for nothing.\n- **Avoid arbitrary choices**: Give clues or distinguishing features so choices feel meaningful, not random.\n\n---\n\n## Integrating with Other Exploration Techniques\n- Use this approach alongside [Hexcrawls](Exploration.Hexcrawls) and [Travel Event Systems](Exploration.TravelEventSystemsPointyHatMethodAndBeyond) to make every scene or location feel interactive.\n- Combine with [Skill Challenges](GameMechanics.ChallengeDesign.SkillChallenges) for group problem-solving moments.\n- For downtime or non-location-based exploration, present multiple, distinct options for how players can spend their time, and let each choice open up new opportunities.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading & References\n- Mystic Arts' [Make Exploration into a Game to Hook Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4Tu2zzDU3I)\n- [Exploration](Exploration)\n- [Hexcrawls](Exploration.Hexcrawls)\n- [Travel Event Systems](Exploration.TravelEventSystemsPointyHatMethodAndBeyond)\n- [Skill Challenges](GameMechanics.ChallengeDesign.SkillChallenges)\n",
