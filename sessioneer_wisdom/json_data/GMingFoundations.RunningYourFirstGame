        "content": "# Running Your First Game\n\nLaunching smoothly from zero to dice-on-the-table.\n\nYour first session as Game Master is equal parts logistics and show-time. This guide condenses newcomer-friendly wisdom from Matthew Colville, Ginny Di, Bob World Builder, Stephanie Plays Games, The Fantasy Forge, and Mystic Arts into a single evening you can actually run.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR Launch Checklist\n\nPrint this page, highlight the boxes.\n\n- [ ] 3-4 Players confirmed (extra chairs & pencils ready?)\n- [ ] Free Basic Rules PDF / SRD link shared (see Ginny Di's [How to be a Dungeon Master (for TOTAL beginners!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCKO6LuXYWE))\n- [ ] Pregenerated character sheets printed (plus blank spares)\n- [ ] One-shot adventure prepped (≈ 5 encounters, 3-4 hrs)\n- [ ] Encounter stat blocks & DCs on one page/card\n- [ ] Physical/digital map (+ tokens or index cards) ready\n- [ ] Safety tool chosen (X-card or Lines & Veils form)\n- [ ] Snacks / break schedule arranged\n- [ ] Session Zero essentials covered  \n  (see [Session Zero Essentials](GMingFoundations.SessionZeroEssentials))\n\nStick to this list and you will eliminate 90% of first-session pain.\n\nHow to use it: Check every box the night before. Anything unticked becomes your *only* prep priority.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Bare Minimum (Matthew Colville & Ginny Di)\n\n> \"You need three things: some friends, the rules, and an adventure.\"\n> \n> -Matthew Colville's [Your First Adventure | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTD2RZz6mlo)\n\n> \"You don't need to spend a dime to be a dungeon master. The list of things you actually need is pretty short: the rules, some dice, and an adventure.\"\n>\n> -Ginny Di, [How to be a Dungeon Master (for TOTAL beginners!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCKO6LuXYWE)\n\n1. **Friends** - 3-4 players keeps spotlight manageable; 5+ slows everything. If you don't have a group, try friends, local game stores, or online platforms. (See Mystic Arts' [You can start playing D&D tonight!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmhFACukQUw))\n2. **Rules** - Hand out the free Basic Rules PDF. You do *not* need to read all three core books before you start. Ginny Di points out you can download the basic rules for free and that's enough to get going.\n3. **Adventure** - A one-night dungeon with ~5 encounters (combat, trap, puzzle, boss) is enough. You can use a published adventure, a free online module, or a simple homebrew. Ginny Di recommends starting with published adventures for your first game.\n\nColville's sample dungeon (The Delian Tomb) shows exactly that structure and is freely available online if you want a ready map.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Pregens > Character-Creation Marathons\n\nBuilding characters is fun *after* players know what the numbers mean. For a debut:\n\n- Print 6-8 official pregens of varied classes.\n- Let players swap equipment/flavour but keep the math.\n- Offer a \"level-up later\" promise so nobody feels locked in.\n\nGinny Di reminds DMs that long char-gen sessions will \"exhaust the hype before the story even starts.\" She and Mystic Arts both recommend pregenerated characters for your first session, so you can get to the fun part-playing-right away. If players want to make their own characters, do it after the first session, once they understand the basics.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Designing the Night: Encounters, Adventures, and Campaigns\n\nColville's pacing rule of thumb: *players clear roughly five scenes in 3-4 hours.* Mix pillars:\n\n1. Guard skirmish (introduce combat rules)\n2. Environmental trap (teach Perception & Investigation)\n3. Social/Exploration room (lore + short rest opportunity)\n4. Boss chamber (climactic fight, simple lair feature)\n5. Twist / roaming patrol that hits from behind (teaches dynamism & consequences)\n\nGinny Di emphasizes that adventures are built from a string of encounters-each is a situation the players must handle, not just a fight. For example, solving a puzzle, negotiating with a guard, or sneaking into a building are all encounters. A published adventure will provide these, but you can also string together your own. Ginny Di recommends not starting with homebrew for your first game: \"It's like trying to write a recipe when you've never cooked before.\"\n\nActionable dial-ups:\n\n- If party breezes through, add one goblin per PC.\n- If they struggle, let the boss flee at half HP.\n\n---\n\n## 3b. 30-Minute, 3-Encounter Map Method (Matthew Colville & Ginny Di)\n\nColville's \"prep in 30 minutes\" video (Prep Can Be Literally Easy and Actually Fun) shows a map-first workflow perfect for brand-new GMs or anyone handed the screen on short notice.\n\n> \"We're going to prep three encounters right now. The easy way. It'll take maybe 30 minutes.\"\n> \n> -Matthew Colville, [Prep Can Be Literally Easy and Actually Fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfiaf9q9Wgo)\n\nGinny Di also recommends keeping your first adventure simple and using published modules or short, free adventures. She notes that encounters are the building blocks of an adventure, and a string of adventures makes a campaign. Don't be afraid to use pre-written material-it's like using a recipe before you start inventing your own dishes.\n\n### Why It Works\n\n1. **Finite scope** - Three scenes is all most first sessions manage.\n2. **Front-loaded inspiration** - Beautiful maps spark adventure ideas faster than blank pages.\n3. **Stat-block snipping** - Pasting only the monsters you need into your notes eliminates book-flipping.\n\n### The Workflow\n\n| Step | What to Do | Tips |\n|------|------------|------|\n| 1️⃣ Pick THREE maps | Scroll Patreon archives or free map sites until you feel *\"Whoa, cool.\"* | One wilderness edge, one interior, one finale location keeps variety. |\n| 2️⃣ Ask \"Why are 1st-level heroes here?\" | Steal the classic **Missing Person** hook: tracks lead off the road into danger. | Keep motive loose; you can nail details down between sessions. |\n| 3️⃣ Drop ONE encounter on each map | Encounter 1 = Ambush, Encounter 2 = Foreshadowing, Encounter 3 = Set-piece | Vary pillars (combat / exploration / undead revelation). |\n| 4️⃣ Snip stat blocks into your doc | Win + Shift + S → paste → resize two per page. | Reskin if needed (Choker → \"Grasping Vines\"). |\n| 5️⃣ Print & Go | Highlight DCs, add HP bubbles, circle the *really* scary ability. | Bring a pencil-write \"George\" next to the spider if they befriend it. |\n\n### Example First Session (lifted straight from the video)\n\n| Map | Scene Beats | Creatures |\n|------|-------------|-----------|\n| **Dark Woods Edge** (forest entrance) | Follow converging footprints - Vines grapple PCs → *then* spiders drop in | 3 Reskinned **Chokers** (vines), 1 **Giant Spider**, 2 **Giant Wolf Spiders** |\n| **Witch's Cottage** | PCs cross a moss-slick log - Search the empty hut - Zombie *minions* besiege the walls | 8-12 **Zombie Minions** (see free MCDM PDF) |\n| **Ruined Chapel** | Fresh ritual circle, empty graves - Tracks of missing paladin & witch vanish - Newly-raised priest-ghast erupts | 1 **Ghast** plus 2-4 **Skeletons** |\n\nColville's pacing knob: delay the spiders or skeletons by 1-2 rounds if vines/zombies hit harder than expected.\n\n### Quick-Level Milestone\n\nEnd the night by letting heroes level to **2nd level** after the cottage fight. It's fun *and* justifies a slightly tougher finale.\n\n### Your Turn\n\n- Swap forest for sewer, cottage for smugglers' den, chapel for submerged shrine-same structure holds.\n- Replace spiders/vines with swarms & animated armour for a gothic feel.\n- If the party *does* clear all three scenes, you still finished inside 3-4 hours.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Tools That Save You Live-Play Panic\n\n| Need | Fast Solution |\n|------|--------------|\n| Initiative order | Clothes-peg on DM screen, or free Combat Manager app |\n| Condition tracking | Cheap coloured rings / rubber bands |\n| Area maps | 1-inch-square wrapping paper backside + dry-erase |\n| Ambient music | 2-song playlist: \"Tavern loop\" & \"Dungeon loop\" only |\n| Rules lookup | CTRL-F in Basic Rules PDF, don't flip books |\n\nThe Fantasy Forge emphasizes \"resource lists\"-pre-write NPC names, taverns, and rumors so surprise detours don't freeze you. Ginny Di recommends a DM screen with basic rules and conditions for quick reference, and notes that you don't need fancy props or minis to run a great game. Use what you have, and improvise when needed.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Explain, Roll, Describe - The New-Player Flow\n\n1. **Prompt** - \"A rusty scythe blade swings from the ceiling. What do you do?\"\n2. **Translate** - If they answer \"I duck,\" call for an appropriate roll (DEX save, DC 12).\n3. **Resolve** - Let the dice speak, then add sensory detail.\n\nBob World Builder's persuasion technique: *\"You tell me intent; I handle mechanics.\"* This keeps novices in story-mode rather than spreadsheet-mode.\n\nGinny Di breaks down the DM's job into three roles: the Lens (describing the world), the Law (applying the rules), and the Living (playing all the NPCs and monsters). As the Lens, your words create the world-if you don't describe it, it doesn't exist. As the Law, you decide when to call for rolls and what kind. As the Living, you bring every NPC and monster to life, but remember: the players are the heroes, and your job is to support their story.\n\n---\n\n### 5a. Opening Scenes - Kick-Starting Play\n\nFirst-session paralysis usually happens in the *first five minutes*. Your job is to break the ice and move the party from small talk to player choice as fast as possible. Matthew Colville offers two evergreen patterns:\n\n#### 1. The Front-Door Drop\n\n> \"Just pow. Drop the players off in front of the dungeon, describe the entrance and tell them the stakes.\"\n> \n> -Matthew Colville's [Your First Session | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K8hGhpQzKg)\n\n- Clear objective: \"Rescue the blacksmith's daughter before the goblins complete their ritual.\"\n- Pacing advantage: players roll initiative within 10 minutes.\n- Use when: limited table time or brand-new players nervous about in-character dialog.\n\nMini-script:\n\n1. Read a 2-sentence opening crawl (stakes + visual).\n2. Ask for marching order / approach.\n3. Call for the group's first roll (Stealth, Perception, or Initiative).\n\n#### 2. The Tavern Meet-Up\n\n- Gives shy players a safe RP sandbox (order drinks, describe themselves).\n- Seeds hooks through NPCs (the blacksmith bursts in; a wanted poster on the wall).\n- Opportunity to practice the \"What do you do?\" loop before danger.\n\nTips for the tavern:\n\n- Go around the table: \"Describe what the others see as you enter.\"\n- Put two talkative, two quiet NPCs on your cheat sheet (name, desire, quirk).\n- Plant the adventure with a sense of urgency (\"If you hurry, she may still be alive\").\n\n#### Decision Table: Which Cold-Open Fits Tonight?\n\n| Situation | Choose |\n|-----------|--------|\n| 2-hour one-shot, mixed ages | Front-Door Drop |\n| New role-players, social focus | Tavern Meet |\n| Online VTT with voice only | Front-Door Drop |\n| Campaign Session 1, story weight | Tavern Meet + short travel montage |\n\n#### Travel Mini-Montage (Optional)\n\nColville slots a short wilderness leg *between* hook and dungeon to make the world feel big and risky:\n\n1. **Track the goblins** - automatic success; novice detective moment.\n2. **Night in the Boar Wood** - have them set watch; roll or narrate a brief encounter.\n3. **Reveal the tomb at dawn** - silhouettes on a hill, patrol visible; ask, \"What's the plan?\"\n\nYou can improvise this in 2-3 sentences yet it triples the sense of adventure.\n\n#### No Map? No Problem\n\n\"Two miles north lies Boar Wood; beyond that, the tomb.\" Medieval peasants had no Google Maps, and describing landmarks keeps mystery high while saving prep time.\n\n---\n\nUse either opener and you'll glide past that awkward \"Uh... I guess we're playing now?\" moment. Then dive straight into the Five-Encounter Framework from section 3.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Table Culture & Safety\n\nEven a one-shot benefits from ground rules:\n\n- One-sentence phone policy (\"silent mode; no scrolling on your turn\").\n- X-card in the centre; explain it takes *zero* justification to tap.\n- 5-minute bio break every hour.\n\nStephanie Plays Games warns that fear of \"DM perfection\" paralyzes newbies; openly admit when you pause to check a rule. Ginny Di emphasizes that the DM is a facilitator, not a dictator: \"You're facilitating the game, not trying to win it. Don't become a Dungeon Master because you want to be in control-you will be disappointed when your players inevitably wreck all your plans and turn your scary villains' names into fart jokes.\"\n\n---\n\n## 7. Finishing Strong\n\n- End 10 minutes early for feedback (\"Rose / Thorn / Bud\" round).\n- Hand players a tangible reward: inspiration token or doodled certificate.\n- Schedule the next game *before anyone leaves the table.*\n\nGinny Di recommends using a structured feedback system like \"Stars and Wishes\"-everyone shares one thing they enjoyed and one thing they'd like to see in the future. This helps you improve and keeps the group engaged.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Common First-Night Hiccups & Quick Fixes\n\n| Symptom | Cause | Patch |\n|---------|-------|-------|\n| Players quiet, unsure | Analysis-paralysis | Offer 2-3 obvious options, then countdown from 5 |\n| Combat dragging | Too many enemies | Halve HP of minions or group their initiative |\n| Rule disputes | \"Page-flipping\" | Flip a coin, rule quickly, research after session |\n| Spotlight hog | Excitement imbalance | Address gently during break, rotate who answers first |\n\n### Ginny Di's Advice for New DMs\n- You don't need to memorize every rule-just know how to find them. It's okay to pause and look things up, or make a ruling and check later.\n- Embrace the chaos: players will do the unexpected. Prepare the world, not the story. Let their choices matter.\n- Remember, the DM is not the enemy. You're there to help everyone have fun-including yourself. If you aren't enjoying DMing, it's okay to step back or try a different system.\n\n---\n\n## 9. What Next?\n\n- Let players *rebuild* characters now that they understand the system.\n- Expand the setting map one hex outward (\"West Marches creep\").\n- Read *Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master* chapter on follow-up prep.\n- Try running a published adventure before homebrewing your own. Ginny Di: \"You'll do a better job creating your own adventures if you've played through some that were written by experienced game designers first.\"\n\nAnd remember Colville's post-mortem wisdom: \"Every time you run it, the adventure - *and you* - get better.\"\n\n---\n\n## 10. The Three Roles of the DM (Ginny Di)\n\nGinny Di breaks down the Dungeon Master's job into three core roles:\n\n1. **The Lens**: You are the players' window into the world. If you don't describe it, it doesn't exist. Your narration sets the tone and provides the information players need to make choices. Use vivid, sensory language and improvise when players ask questions you didn't expect.\n2. **The Law**: You are the referee of the rules. Apply them fairly, but don't be afraid to make judgment calls or adjust rules to keep the game fun. Only call for rolls when the outcome is uncertain and there are consequences for failure. It's okay to make a ruling and look up the answer later.\n3. **The Living**: You play every NPC, monster, and creature in the world. Bring them to life with voices, quirks, and motivations, but remember: the players are the heroes. Your job is to support their story, not overshadow it.\n\n> \"You're facilitating the game, not trying to win it.

Here is a distilled, table-ready version so you can keep it on the back of your screen.\n\n| # | Evergreen Habit | 10-Second Rationale | Quick Implementation |\n|---|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 1 | Keep a **Name List** | Instant verisimilitude beats awkward pauses. | Pre-write 10 ♂ / 10 ♀ / 10 neutral names that fit the setting. Cross them off as you use them. |\n| 2 | **Listen** & let players inspire you | Their theories are free prep! | When a speculation excites the table, jot it as a possible truth. Only lock answers when revealed in-game. |\n| 3 | If momentum dies, **roll initiative** | Action resets energy & buys thinking time. | Toss in a level-appropriate skirmish or environmental hazard the moment table chatter turns to phones. |\n| 4 | **Don't pull the curtain** | The magic is belief. | Save post-session for \"Here's what really happened.\" Keep mid-game explanations minimal. |\n| 5 | **Rules argue? Rule, then move on.** | Flow > accuracy. | Make a fair call, note the page, check it after session. |\n| 6 | Know the **Villain's Plan** | World keeps turning without heroes. | Write 3-step agenda & D-Day timeline. Advance it whenever players dawdle. |\n| 7 | **Fudge for Your Errors, not Theirs** | Encounter difficulty is an untested prototype. | Shielded rolls let you quietly adjust damage or HP if you mis-gauged threat. |\n| 8 | **Err on the Players' Side** | You wield infinite power-they don't. | When uncertainty hurts them, default to \"Yes, but...\" or \"Works this once-next time we'll check the rule.\" |\n\nHow to use: Glance down this table whenever you feel the session stalling or conflict brewing. One of the eight usually offers an immediate fix.\n\n> Take what inspires you. Leave the rest. If you need more advice later, we'll still be here.\n> Close this doc, grab your dice, and start rolling.\n> -Matthew Colville, [Running the Game 100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_r_Xy1ZRbc) \n---\n\n## 11. Embracing Imperfection & Growth (Multiple Authors)\n\n- **Embrace the beginner's mindset**: You will make mistakes, and that's okay. Stephanie Plays Games: \"Embrace the suck. You can't get better if you're only ever just watching from the sidelines.\"\n- **Don't get stuck in prep**: Ginny Di and The Fantasy Forge both warn against endless planning. Start with what you have, and learn by doing.\n- **Collaborate with your players**: Listen to their ideas and let them shape the story. The best moments often come from player creativity, not your prep.\n- **Have fun!**: If you and your players are having fun, you're doing it right. If not, it's okay to try a different approach or even a different game system.\n\n> \"If your players keep coming back, you're doing something right.\"  \n> -The Fantasy Forge, [5 TRUTHS I Wish I Knew Before Being a DM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnvzFWI4NQ0)\n\n> \"No D&D is better than bad D&D.
