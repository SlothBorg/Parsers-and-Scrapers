        "content": "# Undead Monsters Toolkit\nDesigning & running the living-impaired without killing the fun.\n\nMatthew Colville summed it up best:\n> \"Undead are maybe the best bad guys by category in D&D - you can use them at all levels.\"  \n> - Matthew Colville, *Undead | Running the Game* (YouTube)\n\nBelow is a concise field-guide for GMs who want to drop skeleton hordes, wailing banshees, or single, terrifying bodaks into play **without the fight stalling, death-spiralling, or feeling same-y**.\n\n---\n## TL;DR Battle-Prep Checklist\nUse this grid while sketching any undead encounter.\n| ✔ | Question | Why it Matters |\n|--- | ----------- | ---------------|\n| [ ] | Do PCs possess at least one magic weapon or damage rider that bypasses resistances? | Incorporeal undead halve non-magical damage; low-level parties suffer. |\n| [ ] | How many *save-or-suffer* abilities are on the table? | Multiple Strength/Con drainers can cause death spirals. |\n| [ ] | Is the undead's shtick clear to the players in 1-2 rounds? | Make their threat legible or the fight feels arbitrary. |\n| [ ] | Do you have an exit ramp if the CR math lies? | Add/withdraw minions, trigger a lair action, or reveal sunlight vulnerability. |\n| [ ] | What's the narrative hook tying THIS undead to THIS place? | Ghosts/Banshees shine when their backstory surfaces mid-combat.\n\nHow to use: check each box during prep; un-checked items mean you still have work to do.\n\n---\n## 1. Why Undead? 3 Fast Strategic Uses\n1. **Level-Agnostic Foes** - From CR 1/4 Skeletons to CR 17 Nightwalkers, you can escalate tension with the same theme.\n2. **Instant Motivation** - Everyone understands *\"stop the necromancer\"*; minimal exposition.\n3. **Rule-Breaking Permission** - Undead regularly break PC rules (life drain, no concentration, legendary resistances). Players accept this as supernatural, so lean in.\n\n---\n## 2. Corporeal vs. Incorporeal - At a Glance\n| Category | Typical CR Band | Signature Threat | Counter-Play |\n|---------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | --------------|\n| **Corporeal** (Skeletons, Zombies, Ghouls, Whites) | 1/8 - 5 | Claws, Paralysis, Life-Drain, Numbers | Turn Undead, Radiant burst, Area damage |\n| **Incorporeal** (Shadows, Specters, Wraiths, Ghosts, Banshees) | 1/2 - 13 | Resistance to non-magical, Stat Drain, Possession, Wail of Death | Magic weapons, Force/Radiant, Protection from Evil, *Magic Missile* |\n\nColville warning:\n> \"Be careful deploying incorporeal undead, especially if your players don't have magic items yet... A Ghost with 45 HP that everyone does half damage to is mathematically equivalent to 90 HP.\"\n\n---\n## 3. Red-Flag Abilities (Death-Spiral Potential)\n| Ability | Found On | Signs You're in Trouble | Safety Switch |\n|--------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | ---------------|\n| **Strength Drain** | Shadows, Wraiths | Attack rolls & damage drop quickly; PC can't wear armor | Limit enemy count ≤ ½ party size, allow *Lesser Restoration* mid-combat |\n| **Max HP Drain** | Specters, Whites | Healing becomes useless; sudden deaths | Telegraphed visuals (necrotic veins), cap total drain to PC level × 5 |\n| **Save-or-Die (Wail, Death Gaze)** | Banshee, Bodak | One bad Con save wipes a hero | Foreshadow, grant auto-fail only if PC < ½ HP, or treat as Massive Damage (DMG p.273) |\n\n---\n## 4. Tactics by Type\n### Skeletons & Zombies - Cannon Fodder Done Right\n- CR 1/4 means **waves**; echoing Colville's maxim, *\"Any monster can be a minion-it's all a matter of perspective.\"* ([Undead Again!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cSHIULQ06M)) Convert skeletons (or ogres!) to 1 HP minions with full damage to spotlight heroics.  \n- Spice-ups: Rune-carved exploding skeletons (1d6 fire on death) or grabby zombies pinning PCs for skeleton archers.\n\n### Ghouls & Ghasts - Mid-Tier Disablers\n- **Paralyzing Claw** DC 10 seems low but it creates tension; remember elves are immune to ghoul paralysis (but not ghast stench)\n- Treat paralysis duration as 1 minute RAW, but consider the Colville house-rule: **no save each round**, forcing allies to use *Lesser Restoration* or endure the full minute.  \n- Pair **1 Ghast : 4 Ghouls** - aura makes ghouls Turn-resistant; encourages battlefield movement.  \n- At higher tiers, convert ghouls into **minions (1 HP, full damage)** to let level-7+ heroes mow through hordes while the ghast provides the real threat.\n\n### Shadows / Specters / Wraiths - Stat-Sappers\n- Treat as *glass cannons*: low HP but high impact.  \n- Environment: dim corridors so they can retreat through walls; give cleric a radiant sconce to wrestle over.\n\n### Whites - Smart Soldiers\n- Talk & shoot: give them bows or muskets; use Life Drain sparingly (24 h zombie clause rarely matters).  \n- Upgrade: Mythic \"Bright-White\" (AC 16, radiant bolt) for level 8+.\n\n### Ghosts & Banshees - Narrative Powerhouses\n\n#### Ghosts: Combat, Story, and Puzzle Elements\nGhosts are not just another stat block-they are monsters with built-in story hooks and unique combat puzzles. Their unfinished business is the key to both their presence and their defeat. Ghosts can be any alignment and need not have died a tragic death; the only requirement is that they died with something unresolved.\n\n**Combat Tactics & Player Confusion:**\n- Ghosts' incorporeal nature (resistance to nonmagical damage, immunity to many conditions) can make them a slog for unprepared parties. They phase between the Ethereal and Material Planes, making it unclear when they can be hit. Players may waste attacks or spells, unsure if the ghost is vulnerable.\n- Ghosts prioritize their unfinished business over combat. If threatened, they will escape rather than fight to the death.\n- Their attacks include necrotic touch, horrifying visage (which can frighten and age PCs), and possession. Possession is a narrative goldmine-brief the player privately and let them roleplay the ghost's motives.\n\n**Weaknesses & Unfinished Business:**\n- The DM has full license to invent a ghost's unique weakness, often tied to its life or death. This could be the method of their demise, an object of hatred, or a personal item. Fulfilling the ghost's unfinished business is often the most direct way to resolve the haunting.\n- Example: A ghost who died longing to brew a legendary potion can be laid to rest if the party helps complete the brew. A vengeful ghost may only rest when a family line is ended (a tough moral dilemma).\n\n**Ghost Archetypes:**\n- The Friendly Ghost: Non-aggressive, causes trouble accidentally.\n- The Rage Ghost: Died hating everything, now a force of destruction.\n- The Oblivious Ghost: Doesn't know it's dead, ignores evidence.\n- The Poltergeist: Focused on manifestations, not violence.\n- The Tragic Ghost: A dog waiting for its master, a child with a simple wish.\n\n**Encounter Example:**\n> \"Your party arrives in a seaside town plagued by supernatural events. The source is a ghostly child in an abandoned orchard, whose unfinished business is to operate the lighthouse. The party can fight, negotiate, or help the child fulfill his dream, each path leading to different challenges and outcomes.\"  \n> -Master the Dungeon, [D&D Ghosts: A Monster with a Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRC9jHRSwic)\n\n**Design Tips:**\n- Make the ghost's story and unfinished business central to the encounter. Let players investigate, research, and interact with the ghost as a character, not just a monster.\n- Use the ghost's weaknesses and irrational behaviors to create tactical openings or narrative twists.\n- If the party chooses combat, telegraph the ghost's resistances and plane-shifting clearly to avoid frustration.\n\n**Quotes:**\n> \"Ghosts are very versatile and you can easily create meaningful encounters with them. Try to create a ghost in your setting that isn't just a chance encounter, but instead an opportunity for your players to explore your world.\"  \n> -Master the Dungeon, [D&D Ghosts: A Monster with a Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRC9jHRSwic)\n\n- Possession = role-play gold. Brief the player privately.  \n- Banshee's Wail ≥ level 5; foreshadow with shattered glass & sickly flowers.  \n- If party lacks cleric, replace \"drops to 0 HP = death\" with \"drops to 0 = roll one death save instantly\".\n\n### Bodak - Action-Oriented Horror (CR 6)\n- Aura of Annihilation 30 ft (5 necrotic/round) encourages movement.  \n- Death Gaze: Use at initiative 20 so everyone remembers.  \n- Swap Orcus-lore for Vecna, Kyuss, or failed lich experiment without re-statting.\n\n---\n## 5. Encounter Building Pointers\n1. **Double-Check Magic Access** - Party level 4 but no +1 weapons? Cap incorporeal count at *½ party size*.\n2. **Action Economy First** - Solo undead? Add lair actions (bones erupt, spirit lanterns shriek) or minions.\n3. **Radiant ≠ Vulnerable**  - 5e baseline is *no* radiant vulnerability. If you house-rule it, warn cleric/paladin players via lore.\n4. **Deadly-Yet-Fair Formula** (default party of 4):  \n   - Corporeal mix: (Party Level × 0. 5) CR worth of undead.  \n   - Incorporeal mix: (Party Level × 0. 3) CR unless magic weapons common.\n\n---\n## 6. Variants & Upgrades\n| Upgrade | Plug-In Example | Quick Rule |\n|--------- | ---------------- | -----------|\n| *Exploding Death* | Any skeleton | On death, DC 12 Dex save or 1d6 fire |\n| *Action-Oriented Boss* | Wight Captain | Bonus Action \"Command Undead\": 1 ally moves & attacks |\n| *Minion Template* | Zombie Horde | HP 1, same attack; worth 1/10 XP |\n| *Elemental Twist* | Frost Ghoul | Cold damage, vulnerability fire, claw slows |\n| *Mythic Phase 2* | Bodak Herald | On 0 HP rise at half with Sunlight Sensitivity removed but AC 13 only |\n\nFor more on dynamic boss fights see [Boss Encounters](GMingFoundations.RunningYourFirstDungeon) - actionable parallels apply.\n\n---\n## 7. Balancing On the Fly\nGinny Di's rule-of-thumb: *\"Be ready to add HP, reveal a hidden ability, or drop reinforcements if your big bad dies before round 3. \"* - *Fixing Boring D&D Monsters* (YouTube)  \nKeep a sticky note with one contingency from each column:\n- +25 HP  - Flesh Golem bursts in  - Necrotic shield (resistance 1 rnd)\n\nDeploy **one** only if the party is yawning, not cheering.\n\n---\n## 8. Quick Reference Table (print & tuck behind the screen)\n| Name | CR | Hook / Use | Surprise Variant |\n|------ | ---- | ----------- | -------------------|\n| Skeleton | 1/4 | Arrow-fodder, rune guardians | Explodes on death |\n| Ghoul | 1 | Small unit disablers | Paralyzing claw also poisons |\n| Shadow | 1/2 | Drain STR in dark corridors | Attaches to PC shadow (Stealth 23) |\n| Wraith | 5 | Mid-boss with spawn risk | Creates 1 Specter at 50% HP |\n| Ghost | 4 | Role-play pivot, possession | Offers bargain while inhabiting PC |\n| Bodak | 6 | Horror set-piece, aura chase | Death Gaze recharges on fire dmg |\n\n---\n### Final Word\nUndead are *tools*, not tropes. Deploy the right tool for the right job: zombies for scale, ghasts for tension, ghosts for story, bodaks for fear. Keep an eye on death spirals, telegraph unfair powers, and let clerics feel awesome for packing radiant damage.\n\nRaise the dead responsibly, GM.\n",
