        "content": "# Guilds\n\nGuilds are a staple of fantasy worlds-powerful organizations that shape economies, politics, and adventures. This guide synthesizes the best advice for creating, running, and leveraging guilds in your TTRPG campaigns, with actionable tools, examples, and tables for instant use. Drawing from Master the Dungeon's [Simple Guilds for D&D 5e](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5SDRjlDEmU), the Dungeon Master's Guide, and curated web resources, this page will help you make guilds a living, memorable part of your world.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR Checklist\n- [ ] Name, trade, core beliefs, and goals\n- [ ] Guild favorability & renown systems (see below for differences)\n- [ ] NPC roster (guildmaster, officers, notable members)\n- [ ] List of guild services (for members & outsiders)\n- [ ] Quest/job board with sample quests\n- [ ] Membership requirements & ranks\n- [ ] Brief guild lore & founding reason\n- [ ] Adventure hooks for player interaction\n- [ ] Internal/external rivalries and politics\n- [ ] Use the generator tables below for instant inspiration\n\n**How to use this checklist:**\nUse it when prepping a new guild or fleshing out an existing one. Add detail as players interact more deeply, just like with [Taverns](WorldBuilding.TownsAndCities.Taverns). Use the checklist as a living document-expand as the party gets more involved, and don't over-prep at the start.\n\n## 1. What is a Guild?\nA guild is a group of professionals united by trade, purpose, or ambition. In D&D, guilds serve as quest-givers, power brokers, and social hubs. They can be as simple as a local blacksmiths' union or as complex as a continent-spanning thieves' syndicate.\n\n> \"A guild is simply a type of organization... They also serve as their own miniature governments, quest givers, and major players in world events.\"  \n-Master the Dungeon, [Simple Guilds for D&D 5e](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5SDRjlDEmU)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core Mechanics: Renown & Favorability\n\n### Renown (DMG p.21-23)\n- Tracks a character's standing within the guild. Completing missions or advancing guild goals increases renown; opposing them decreases it.\n- Unlocks ranks, perks, titles, and access to special resources or downtime activities.\n- Example ranks: Initiate, Veteran, Master. Each rank can grant new privileges (e.g., discounted services, access to restricted areas, ability to recruit NPCs).\n\n### Favorability (Master the Dungeon)\n- A sliding scale (-5 to +5) for the guild's current attitude toward the party. Unlike renown, favorability can change quickly and is used for determining DCs for requests (e.g., DC 20 for hostile, DC 10 for friendly).\n- Favorability reflects the emotional alignment of the guild toward the party, while renown is reputation-based.\n- Example: A party with high renown but low favorability might be famous but disliked (perhaps due to abrasive personalities or recent failures).\n\n> \"Favorability... is a number line that your players move along. The number of steps to move in any direction is up to you, but we typically recommend -5 to 5 with your party starting at 0. \"  \n-Master the Dungeon, [Simple Guilds for D&D 5e](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5SDRjlDEmU)\n\n#### Using Both Systems\n- Use renown for long-term progression and unlocking perks.\n- Use favorability for short-term interactions and request DCs.\n- Example: At +3 favorability, the party might get free healing potions; at -2, the guild might send spies to watch them.\n\n### Membership & Ranks\n- Define requirements (fees, quests, skills) and benefits (discounts, access, training).\n- Consider multiple membership tiers: Associate (basic quest access), Full Member (voting rights, shared profits), Leader (authority to dispatch NPCs).\n- Annual dues, oaths, or renown thresholds can all be used as requirements.\n\n#### For more, see: [Guild Design (5e Guideline)](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Guild_Design_(5e_Guideline)) and the [Dungeon Master's Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-guide#FactionsandOrganizations).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Guild Structure & NPCs\n\nA well-structured guild has a clear hierarchy and memorable NPCs. You don't need to over-prep-start with names, roles, and a quirk or two. Expand as the campaign progresses.\n\n- **Guildmaster**: The leader, face, or power behind the guild. May be public or secretive.\n- **Officers**: Treasurer, questmaster, enforcer, recruiter, archivist, etc. Each officer can be a recurring quest-giver or source of intrigue.\n- **Members**: Recurring NPCs, rivals, allies, and quest-givers. Rotate minor NPCs in and out to keep the guild feeling alive.\n- **Rivals**: Consider internal factions (e.g., traditionalists vs. reformers) and external rivals (e.g., competing guilds, city watch).\n\n> \"An NPC roster for a guild is a simple list of NPC characters you spin up beforehand... They don't have to be super unique, but they should all fill a role in the guild.\"  \n-Master the Dungeon\n\n**Tip:** The NPC your players interact with most (e.g., the front desk clerk or questmaster) will naturally become the face of the guild. Give them a memorable personality and let their role grow with the story.\n\nFor inspiration, see the NPC generator table below.\n\n## 4. Guild Services\n\nGuilds exist to provide value to their members and, sometimes, the wider community. Services can be mundane or magical, and may be restricted by rank, favorability, or payment.\n\n- **Quest/job boards**: The heart of most guilds. Keep a rotating list of jobs-monster hunts, investigations, odd jobs, etc.\n- **Item shops & rare goods**: Access to unique equipment, magical items, or exotic wares.\n- **Spellcasting & training**: Offer spellcasting services, magical research, or skill training.\n- **Lodging & banking**: Cheap or free rooms, secure storage, or even loans.\n- **Legal aid & political leverage**: Help with the law, bribes, or pulling strings in city politics.\n- **Information brokering**: Rumors, secrets, and intelligence for sale.\n\n> \"A guild's services are almost never free, but they're also not always listed out on a menu... understanding both sides of the equation will be helpful in your game.\"  \n-Master the Dungeon\n\n**Tip:** Not all services are available to outsiders. Use renown, favorability, or special quests as gates to the best perks.\n\n## 5. Guild Lore, History & Hooks\n\n### Founding Reason & Lore\n- Ask: Why was the guild formed? What problem did it solve? (e.g., a farmers' guild to set crop prices and protect against famine, a thieves' guild to regulate crime and avoid city crackdowns)\n- Consider: Who benefits from the guild's existence? Who opposes it? (e.g., the kingdom may dislike a powerful farmers' guild, but tolerate it to avoid economic disaster)\n- Write a short paragraph of internal lore for each guild you create. This is for you, not the players-use it to guide NPC motivations and world events.\n\n> \"Ask what the problem was that people were solving when they banded together to form the group. This provides understanding and context that you can use in future storytelling.\"  \n-Master the Dungeon\n\n### Player Hooks\n- How do players first encounter the guild? Are they members from the start (great for uniting disparate backstories), or do they meet the guild as outsiders?\n- If the party is new to the area, introduce the guild through a friendly NPC or a required registration process.\n- Prepare a basic rundown of the guild's purpose, services, and reputation for the players-either as common knowledge or through NPC dialogue.\n\n**Tip:** The guild's story can advance in the background, but focus on the NPCs and plot hooks that matter most to your players.\n\n## 6. Running Guilds in Play\n\n- Use favorability and renown to track relationships and unlock content. Favorability is for short-term requests and roleplay; renown is for long-term progression.\n- Keep a simple NPC roster and update as needed. Let recurring NPCs develop naturally as the party interacts with them.\n- Refresh the quest board regularly. Prepare a handful of quest templates and rotate them as needed.\n- Let the guild's story advance in the background, but focus on the NPCs players interact with most. Major plot points can move forward off-screen, with rumors or changes revealed when the party returns.\n- Use guilds as both patrons and antagonists. Internal strife, rival guilds, or political intrigue can all provide adventure hooks.\n\n> \"The nice thing about guilds is that they pretty much run themselves... If you have a more present and active group of NPCs, you can work out some stories and gossip for when your party returns, but guilds are stable and well managed and should appear mostly frozen in time.\"  \n-Master the Dungeon\n\n**For more on integrating guilds into campaigns, see:**\n- [Simple Guilds for D&D 5e](https://www.masterthedungeon.com/simple-guilds-for-dnd-5e/)\n- [Guild Design (5e Guideline)](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Guild_Design_(5e_Guideline))\n- [Dungeon Master's Guide, Factions & Organizations](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-guide#FactionsandOrganizations)\n\n---\n\n## 7.
