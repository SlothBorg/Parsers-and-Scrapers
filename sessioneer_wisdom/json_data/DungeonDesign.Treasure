        "content": "# Treasure\n\nA comprehensive guide to designing, placing, and narratively integrating treasure in your dungeons. This document synthesizes advice from top GMs and designers, providing actionable techniques, inspiring examples, and a variety of perspectives on how to make treasure meaningful, memorable, and fun.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR Checklist: Dungeon Treasure Design\n- Consider the age, history, and current use of the dungeon when placing treasure\n- In young or functional dungeons, treasure is likely to be practical, well-guarded, and integrated into the daily life of the inhabitants (e.g., weapons, documents, keys, valuables in vaults or on guards)\n- Make loot narratively significant, not just a mechanical reward\n- Use a mix of mundane, magical, and narrative rewards\n- Let the condition and type of treasure reflect the dungeon's story\n- Provide meaningful ways for players to spend or use their loot\n- Make selling or using treasure a story in itself\n- Use treasure to motivate player behavior you want to see\n- Include risks, consequences, and surprises with loot\n- Use single-use, limited, or weird magic items to avoid power creep\n- Reward curiosity, ambition, and engagement\n\n**How to use this checklist:**\nBefore stocking a dungeon, review each point and consider how it applies to your adventure. Use the examples and techniques below to inspire your own treasure hoards and reward systems.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Effects of Age and Environment on Loot\n> \"When your players sack an ancient temple or clear a crumbling dungeon, they expect to find some loot. But an often overlooked feature of these older dungeons is spoilage and decay... The main thing you should be thinking about every time you place loot in these old and dusty places is the effect that time would have on an object.\"  \n- Master the Dungeon, [The Effects of Age on Loot in D&D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgxWM_TD-Mk)\n\n- **Consumables:** Food is almost always spoiled unless magically preserved. Potions may have side effects or reduced potency-consider using a random table for aged potions (see below for a sample table).\n- **Weapons & Gear:** Most mundane gear will be rusted, brittle, or in need of repair. Leather straps may have deteriorated, latches may not work, and mechanisms may be seized. Magical items resist decay and stand out among ruined equipment. For a memorable set piece, describe a forgotten armory filled with piles of rust and ruined gear, with a few pristine magical items gleaming among the decay.\n- **Coins & Valuables:** Gold and platinum survive, but copper and silver may corrode or fuse into lumps. Ancient coins may need to be exchanged or melted down, and their origin can be a story hook. For example, a pile of copper coins in a moist environment may have fused into a greenish lump, requiring effort to salvage. Silver tarnishes slowly, but in volcanic or sulfurous dungeons, it may blacken and soften. Ancient coins with the face of a tyrant may require a shady fence to exchange.\n- **Books & Scrolls:** Paper rarely survives centuries (even the best paper lasts about 500 years in ideal conditions). Vellum (animal skin) or magically protected tomes might survive much longer. Surviving texts are often rare, valuable, and possibly sinister-necromancers may prefer vellum for their spellbooks. Tablets, tapestries, and magical inscriptions may also endure.\n- **Storytelling Tip:** Let the state of the treasure tell the story of the dungeon's past. A pristine sword among rusted weapons hints at magic or recent activity. A fused pile of copper coins shows centuries of neglect. A bookshelf of crumbling tomes, with only a few vellum or magically protected books remaining, can hint at the dungeon's age and the priorities of its former inhabitants.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Making Loot Matter: Narrative and Mechanical Integration\n> \"Loot in D&D should be fun, but a lot of the time it just ends up being annoying... How do we weave loot and player rewards into the story we're telling and make it exciting and part of the narrative instead of just an accounting obligation?\"  \n- Ginny Di, [How to make D&D loot matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omLcTk6FYYo)\n\n- **Opportunities to Spend:** Ensure players have meaningful ways to use their wealth-property, custom items, travel, charity, or unique experiences.\n- **Selling Treasure:** Make selling rare or unusual items a quest or challenge. The more valuable or unique the item, the more effort required to find a buyer.\n- **Non-Material Rewards:** Consider blessings, boons, titles, land, or access to new areas as treasure. These can be powerful motivators and story hooks.\n- **Information as Treasure:** Letters, journals, and clues can be as valuable as gold, especially when tied to the plot.\n- **Consequences:** Sometimes, treasure comes with strings attached-cursed items, vengeful heirs, or becoming a target for thieves.\n\n**Example:**\n- The party finds a magical amulet, but it's a family heirloom. The rightful owner's descendants may seek revenge or try to reclaim it.\n- A pile of ancient coins bears the face of a long-dead tyrant. Exchanging them for modern currency requires dealing with a shady fence or a suspicious banker.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Motivating Player Behavior with Treasure\n> \"The behavior a game rewards is the behavior a game encourages... Classic D&D was all about risking your life looking for loot. It was a much more survival based game, much more about horror. Dungeons were dark and scary and life was cheap... You got experience points for finding gold. 1 XP per gold piece.\"  \n- Matthew Colville, [Toward Better Rewards | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwpQwCWdhL8)\n\n- **Reward Curiosity and Proactivity:** Place treasure in locations that reward exploration, cleverness, and risk-taking.\n- **Goal-Oriented Rewards:** Tie specific treasures or rewards to player-driven goals. Use cards or notes to make goals and rewards explicit.\n- **Mix of Rewards:** Combine gold, magic items, narrative rewards, and new abilities to keep things fresh and engaging.\n- **Avoid Over-Reliance on Gold:** If gold is plentiful, ensure there are meaningful sinks for it, or shift focus to other types of rewards.\n\n**Example:**\n- A player expresses interest in a lost temple. Place a unique magic item or lore there, and make the reward clear if they pursue it.\n- Completing a personal quest might grant a new skill, a title, or a unique magic item tied to the character's story.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Magic Items: Balancing Power and Creativity\n> \"If you're worried about giving out magic items because you're afraid of making your players overpowered, you are not alone... That's why when it comes to magic items, I say the weirder the better. Not only does it help mitigate this issue of overpowered magic items, but it also pushes players to be more creative with their problem solving.\"  \n- Ginny Di, [How to make D&D loot matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omLcTk6FYYo)\n\n- **Single-Use & Limited Items:** Chimes of Opening, Feather Tokens, and other consumables encourage creative use without long-term power creep.\n- **Weird & Situational Items:** Items like the Immovable Rod or Slippers of Spider Climb are memorable and encourage inventive play.\n- **Narrative Magic Items:** Ancestral weapons that grow with the character, or items with story significance, are more engaging than generic +1 swords.\n\n**Example:**\n- The party finds a magical tree token. They use it to block a corridor, create cover, or escape a collapsing room-memorable and impactful.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Integrating Treasure into the Dungeon's Story\n- Let the treasure reflect the dungeon's history, culture, and former inhabitants.\n- Use treasure as a clue to the dungeon's secrets or as a hook for future adventures.\n- Mix mundane and magical, valuable and sentimental, to create a believable and immersive hoard.\n\n**Example:**\n- In a necromancer's lair, the only surviving books are written on vellum-grim, but a clue to the villain's methods and mindset.\n- A tapestry, faded but intact, depicts a forgotten battle. It's valuable to the right collector and reveals a lost piece of history.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Risks, Surprises, and Consequences\n- Not all treasure is safe or easy to use. Cursed items, dangerous potions, or loot with political baggage can complicate the party's life.\n- Sometimes, the act of taking treasure triggers traps, alarms, or new story complications.\n\n**Example:**\n- A potion found in a centuries-old crypt has a 50% chance of being spoiled, a 25% chance of being weakened, and a 5% chance of being extra potent.\n- The party's newfound wealth draws the attention of thieves, rivals, or even the authorities.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Practical Tips for Placing Treasure\n- Use random tables for inspiration, but always tailor loot to your story and party.\n- Think about what the dungeon's builders valued-what would they have left behind, hidden, or protected?\n- Don't be afraid to let some treasure be lost to time, or require effort to recover or restore.\n- Make treasure memorable: give it a name, a history, or a quirk.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading\n- [DungeonDesign.Traps](DungeonDesign.Traps) - For integrating treasure with traps and challenges\n- [Quests.QuestRewards](Quests.QuestRewards) - For more on non-material and narrative rewards\n\n---\n\n## Sources & Inspiration\n- Master the Dungeon, [The Effects of Age on Loot in D&D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgxWM_TD-Mk)\n- Ginny Di, [How to make D&D loot matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omLcTk6FYYo)\n- Matthew Colville, [Toward Better Rewards | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwpQwCWdhL8)\n\n---\n\nBy weaving together these techniques and perspectives, you can make dungeon treasure a highlight of your adventures-something your players look forward to, remember, and talk about long after the session ends.\n\n---\n\n### Example Table: Effects of Age on Potions (from Master the Dungeon)\nWhen players find potions in an ancient dungeon, roll a d20 to determine the potion's condition:\n\n| d20 Roll | Potion Condition         | Effect                                                                 |\n|---------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1-5      | Nauseating Potion       | Potion has gone bad; drinker is nauseous for 1d4 hours.                |\n| 6-8      | Potion with Side Effect | Potion does not work as intended; produces a random status effect for 1d4 hours (roll on a wild magic table or improvise). |\n| 9-12     | Weakened Potion         | Potion works, but only provides half the benefits.                     |\n| 13-19    | Normal Potion           | Potion works as intended.                                              |\n| 20       | Better with Age         | Potion's effects are doubled.                                          |\n\n> \"You can use the following table in your games... This table is a little silly, but it sends an important message to your players to consider their surroundings. You can't expect to live a long life as an adventurer if you randomly quaff mysterious liquids you find laying around in ancient tombs.\"  \n- Master the Dungeon, [The Effects of Age on Loot in D&D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgxWM_TD-Mk)\n\n#### Example: Ancient Armory Set Piece\n>\"The party stumbles into a forgotten armory deep within the dungeon's maze-like structures. The age and decay is seen in the piles of rust as time has brought low this once mighty arsenal. But wait, what's this? Among the ruined gear stands several pristine items that look as if they were forged only yesterday. Not a scratch on them. They stand amidst the chaos of age set upon the room. Your players just found the magical items inherent to the dungeon.\"  \n- Paraphrased from Master the Dungeon\n\n#### Example: Fused Copper Coins\n>\"A collection of pure copper coins might fuse into a solid green mound that would have to be carried out of the dungeon to be salvaged for a meager sum.\"  \n- Master the Dungeon\n\n#### Example: Surviving Vellum Spellbook\n>\"The wizard is likely to find a bookshelf full of crumbling covers that turn to dust in their hands except for the ones written on skin. While we're not presuming that all vellum has evil writings on it, the beings that are evil likely prefer to write on paper made out of skin. It can be assumed that the remaining books in any ancient magical archive are typically not the nicest types of magic.\"  \n- Master the Dungeon\n\n#### Example: Outdated Coinage\n>\"Not every coin you find will be something that you can spend, especially if it has the face of an evil overlord stamped on it. When placing coins, think about how long it would have been there-if it's been hundreds or even thousands of years, then it likely needs to be converted to the present currency of the realm.\"  \n- Master the Dungeon\n\n---\n\n### Quick Template: Describing Ancient Loot\n- **Consumables:** Spoiled food, dubious cheese, or aged mushrooms; potions may be spoiled (roll on the table above)\n- **Weapons & Gear:** Mostly rusted, brittle, or broken; a few pristine magical items stand out\n- **Coins:** Gold and platinum are intact; silver is tarnished, copper is fused or corroded; ancient coins may need to be exchanged\n- **Books & Scrolls:** Most paper is dust; a few vellum or magically protected tomes survive\n- **Other:** Tapestries, tablets, or magical inscriptions may remain\n\nUse this template to quickly describe the state of loot in any ancient or abandoned dungeon.\n",
