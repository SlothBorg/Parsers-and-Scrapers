This document synthesizes advice from leading GMs and RPG educators, providing actionable steps and real-world examples.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR Checklist\n- [ ] Set clear expectations and table etiquette from the start\n- [ ] Use Session Zero to align playstyles and campaign goals\n- [ ] Address disruptive or difficult behavior promptly and constructively\n- [ ] Encourage quiet or shy players with gentle prompts and fair warning\n- [ ] Rotate spotlight time and share narrative focus\n- [ ] Foster party cohesion through shared goals and in-game bonds\n- [ ] Solicit and act on session feedback\n- [ ] Accept that not every group is a perfect fit-sometimes, parting ways is healthiest\n\n**How to Use This Checklist:**\nReview these points before starting a campaign and revisit them whenever table dynamics feel off. Use them as a diagnostic tool for group issues and as a prep guide for new games.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Setting Expectations and Table Etiquette\n- **Session Zero is essential.** Discuss campaign tone, playstyle (combat, roleplay, sandbox, etc.), and table rules. Be specific-\"roleplay heavy\" means different things to different people. (See Pointy Hat's [What No One Tells You About DMing D&D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUhWlfH68L4))\n- **Establish etiquette:** Phones, snacks, rules debates, and how to handle disagreements. Make sure everyone knows the GM's word is final in the moment, but rules can be discussed after the session. (Matthew Mercer's [RPG Etiquette! (Game Master Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9X2Tz7QegM))\n\n## 2. Handling Disruptive or Difficult Players\n- **Address issues early and directly.** If a player is disruptive, talk to them-ideally at the table, with the group, so they see the social impact. Lead with inclusion: \"I want you to have fun with us, but I also want to have fun.\" (Matthew Colville's [Problem Players | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lEi9DAn9rE))\n- **Be specific about the problem.** Identify what behavior is disruptive and how it affects the group. Avoid vague complaints-focus on actions, not character.\n- **If needed, part ways.** Sometimes, a player or group is simply not a good fit. That's okay-no D&D is better than bad D&D. (Ginny Di's [Talk to your D&D party like an adult, please](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5RH8Z4-ipc))\n\n## 3. Encouraging Shy or Quiet Players\n- **Give fair warning for spotlight moments.** Let players know in advance if you'll ask them to roleplay or make a big decision. (Matthew Colville's [Fair Warning | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpjeBLoIdQ0))\n- **Use gentle prompts.** Address quiet players directly but kindly: \"What does your character do next?\" or have NPCs interact with them.\n- **Avoid putting audience members on the spot.** Some players are happy to watch and participate minimally. If they're having fun, that's enough. (Matthew Colville's [Different Kinds of Players | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQsJSqn71Fw))\n\n## 4. Spotlight Management and Engagement\n- **Rotate spotlight time.** Make sure each player gets a chance to act, especially in roleplay and exploration scenes. Use initiative order for social scenes if needed.\n- **Share narrative focus.** Encourage players to build connections between their characters and the world, and to support each other's moments.\n- **Address spotlight hogging.** If a player dominates, talk to them privately and encourage them to share the stage. (Matthew Mercer's [RPG Etiquette! (Game Master Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9X2Tz7QegM))\n\n## 5. Fostering Party Cohesion\n- **Build in shared goals and backstory ties.** Use Session Zero to create party bonds and shared motivations. (See [Character Creation: Guiding Players & Building Parties](GMingFoundations.CharacterCreationGuidingPlayersNBuildingParties))\n- **Encourage in-game teamwork.** Present challenges that require cooperation and reward group problem-solving.\n- **Address intra-party conflict early.** If characters clash, check in with players to ensure it's fun for everyone and not bleeding into real-life tension.\n\n## 6. Session Feedback and Debriefs\n- **Ask for feedback after sessions.** Use short, specific questions: What did you enjoy? What could be better? (Pointy Hat's [What No One Tells You About DMing D&D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUhWlfH68L4))\n- **Act on feedback.** Make small changes and let players know their input matters. This builds trust and investment.\n\n## 7. Accepting Imperfection and Knowing When to Move On\n- **Not every group is a perfect fit.** Sometimes, despite best efforts, the group dynamic doesn't work. It's okay to end a campaign or part ways with a player.\n- **Prioritize fun and respect.** The goal is for everyone to enjoy themselves. If that's not happening, it's time for a change.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading & Cross-References\n- [Session Pacing and Table Management](GMingFoundations.SessionPacingAndTableManagement): For advice on keeping sessions moving and managing table energy.\n- [Engaging Players: Making Lore and Adventure Compelling](GMingFoundations.EngagingPlayersMakingLoreAndAdventureCompelling): For tips on making your world matter to your players.\n- [Session Zero Essentials](GMingFoundations.SessionZeroEssentials): For structuring your campaign's launch and aligning expectations.\n\n---\n\n## Inspiring Example: The \"Fair Warning\" Technique\n> \"The day before we played, I said, an NPC is gonna come up to you tomorrow and ask you, why are you helping us? ... I just gave the player a prompt and let them think about it. The moment came, the player was ready. They role played well. ... Having this stepping stone, this comfortable space between the Eye of Sauron and natural, spontaneous role playing made a huge difference.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Fair Warning | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpjeBLoIdQ0)\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n- Set expectations and etiquette early\n- Address issues directly and constructively\n- Encourage all players, but respect different engagement styles\n- Rotate spotlight and foster party bonds\n- Solicit and act on feedback\n- Accept that sometimes, moving on is healthiest for everyone\n\n> \"We're all there to have fun. We're all there to have a great experience together and I think following a lot of these little guidelines should help maintain that quite nicely.\"  \n> -Matthew Mercer, [RPG Etiquette!
