        "content": "# Efficient Session Prep\n\nA practical, multi-perspective guide to prepping sessions quickly, flexibly, and with maximum impact. Synthesizes advice from Stephanie Plays Games, Bob World Builder, Matthew Mercer, The Fantasy Forge, and more.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR Checklist\n- [ ] Prep for the session, not the whole campaign\n- [ ] Review previous session notes and player character goals\n- [ ] Create a strong start (in media res, action, or intrigue)\n- [ ] Outline 8-10 secrets and clues that can be discovered in multiple ways\n- [ ] Prepare flexible scenes, not rigid scripts\n- [ ] List key NPCs, locations, and monsters (with names and a line of description)\n- [ ] Keep a list of random names and rewards handy\n- [ ] Take notes during and after the session for future prep\n- [ ] Use feedback (e.g., \"stars and wishes\") to improve\n\n### How to Use This Checklist\nUse this before each session to focus your prep on what matters most. After the session, review and update your notes for next time.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Prep for the Session, Not the Saga\nFocus on what the players will see, do, and care about in the next session. Keep long-term ideas as bullet points or loose notes-only flesh them out when relevant.\n\n> \"I used to sit down and try to write some Tolkien level 10 layer plot for every single campaign... and then my players would spend all this time trying to get into a locked bakery instead of caring about all that lore that I had created.\"  \n> -The Fantasy Forge, [I was drowning in lore... until I did these 5 THINGS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZnYDXNrW60)\n\n**Example 1:** Matt Colville preps only enough of a published adventure to run the first session, then reads/skims more as needed. He focuses on the next chunk of content, not the whole campaign. (See Colville's [Prepping An Adventure | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXYORWtiLF0))\n\n**Example 2:** Stephanie Plays Games reviews her previous session notes and player goals, then preps a strong start, 8-10 secrets, and a few flexible scenes-never the whole campaign arc. ([Prep FAST, Prep FUN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiuOS2XMT9U))\n\n**Alternative Approach:** For minimalist prep, try Sly Flourish's \"Lazy DM\" method: prep only what you need for the next session, keep everything else as loose ideas. For maximalist prep, outline the campaign arc but only detail the next session.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Review Previous Notes and Player Goals\nStart by reviewing your last session's notes and each PC's goals, backstory, and recent choices. This ensures your prep is relevant and personal.\n\n> \"The most interesting part of our games has little to do with us as DMs. For our players, the thing they're most likely to remember is if they did something cool or had an interesting choice to agonize over.\"  \n> -Stephanie Plays Games, [Prep FAST, Prep FUN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiuOS2XMT9U)\n\n**Example:** Before prepping, scan your notes for unresolved character goals (e.g., a PC searching for a lost artifact, a rivalry with an NPC). Plan to bring one of these threads into the next session-maybe the artifact surfaces in a rumor, or the rival appears in town.\n\n**Alternative Approach:** Ginny Di recommends taking quick, bullet-point notes during the session, then reviewing and refining them after. Focus on what you'll forget, what will come up again, and what will impact future prep. ([No time to take notes while DMing? Try this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UU40lr42tQ))\n\n---\n\n## 3. Create a Strong Start\nBegin sessions with action, intrigue, or a dramatic moment. Avoid slow starts-jump into the middle of something exciting or important.\n\n> \"I start nearly every session in media res-jumping straight into the action or something important. Don't waste it with 'you walk into a tavern' unless your players really love that stuff.\"  \n> -Stephanie Plays Games, [Prep FAST, Prep FUN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiuOS2XMT9U)\n\n**Example 1:** Start with \"The city gates slam shut behind you as the guards shout, 'Stop those thieves!'\" instead of \"You arrive in town.\"\n\n**Example 2:** For a social session, open with a tense negotiation already in progress, or a dramatic reveal (\"The mayor accuses you of treason!\").\n\n**Alternative Approach:** If your group prefers a slower build, use vivid, sensory descriptions to highlight interactable elements and let players choose what to engage with. (See Mystic Arts' [Make Exploration into a Game to Hook Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4Tu2zzDU3I))\n\n---\n\n## 4. Outline Secrets and Clues\nPrepare 8-10 secrets or clues for the session. These can be discovered in any way the players choose-through investigation, conversation, or exploration. This keeps your prep flexible and ensures key information gets to the players.\n\n> \"Decentralizing your prep means not locking players into specific decisions. Secrets and clues give you the freedom to let players follow their own paths while still guiding them toward the bigger picture.\"  \n> -Stephanie Plays Games, [Prep FAST, Prep FUN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiuOS2XMT9U)\n\n**Example:** In a mystery session, prepare clues that can be found in different rooms, from different NPCs, or even through failed skill checks (the clue is less clear, but still present). This is the core of the \"Three Clue Rule\"-never rely on a single clue to move the story forward. (See [Mystery Adventures and the Three Clue Rule](Storytelling.NarrativeTechniques.MysteryAdventuresAndTheThreeClueRule))\n\n**Alternative Approach:** For exploration-heavy sessions, highlight interactable objects or locations in your descriptions, and let players choose which to investigate. Each can reveal a different piece of the puzzle. (See Mystic Arts' [Make Exploration into a Game to Hook Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4Tu2zzDU3I))\n\n---\n\n## 5. Prepare Flexible Scenes and NPCs\nOutline potential scenes, locations, and NPCs, but keep details light. Focus on what makes each scene or character interesting. Use templates or bullet points for quick reference.\n\n> \"90% of gameplay is made up on the spot. The only guarantee is for your party to do something you did not expect. So embrace the chaos.\"  \n> -Bob World Builder, [How To PREPARE A D&D Session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEZrMqGCI-M)\n\n**Example:** For each location, jot down a one-sentence description, a list of NPCs (with names and a quirk), and a few possible events. If the players go off-script, improvise using these notes as a springboard.\n\n**Alternative Approach:** Matt Colville annotates maps and keeps a list of key NPCs and their motivations, but improvises dialogue and details as needed. (See Colville's [Prepping An Adventure | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXYORWtiLF0))\n\n---\n\n## 6. Keep Tools and Resources Handy\nHave a list of random names, rewards, and stat blocks ready. Use a binder, digital tool, or index cards for quick access. Keep your GM area organized for fast reference.\n\n> \"Your area behind the GM screen is your saving grace. Keep notes, names, and tools at your disposal for when the unexpected happens.\"  \n> -Matthew Mercer, [Setting Up Your Gamemaster's Screen!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMVTmbe-Is)\n\n**Example:** Keep a page of fantasy names divided by race/gender, a list of quick NPC quirks, and a few generic stat blocks. When players ask for a name or interact with an unexpected NPC, you can respond instantly.\n\n**Alternative Approach:** The Fantasy Forge recommends using digital tools (like Milanote or Google Docs) to keep all your notes, maps, and reference images in one place for easy access.

Take Notes During and After the Session\nTake notes on what happens, who the players meet, and what they care about. Use mind maps, scatterplots, or bullet points. After the session, summarize key events and update your prep for next time.\n\n> \"Take notes like your future self depends on it. Write with enough context that a stranger could run your game from them.\"  \n> -The Fantasy Forge, [I was drowning in lore... until I did these 5 THINGS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZnYDXNrW60)\n\n**Example:** Ginny Di suggests making note-taking as easy as possible-use bullet points, abbreviations, and jot down only what you'll forget, what will come up again, or what will impact your prep. After the session, review and clarify your notes for next time. ([No time to take notes while DMing? Try this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UU40lr42tQ))\n\n**Alternative Approach:** If you struggle to take notes during play, ask a player to be the session scribe, or record the session (with permission) and summarize key points afterward.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Use Feedback to Improve\nAsk players for feedback at the end of each session (e.g., \"stars and wishes\"). Use this to adapt your prep and focus on what your group enjoys most.\n\n> \"Check in with your players. Maybe the class they chose just isn't as fun as they thought, or there's a cool new magic item they want you to incorporate in the game. Or maybe they just need tonight's session to be lighthearted and fun because they're going through something rough in their personal life. That's okay, but don't leave it up to your players to tell you this stuff. It is your responsibility as the leader of that table to ask them how they're feeling.\"  \n> -Bob World Builder, [How To Keep Your Players' ATTENTION In D&D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbWEJRQX0tU)\n\n**Example:** After a session, ask each player for one thing they enjoyed and one thing they'd like to see more of. Use this feedback to adjust your prep and focus on what your group enjoys most.\n\n**Alternative Approach:** Ginny Di recommends a \"one thing you want, one thing you don't want\" roundtable during session zero or campaign check-ins. This helps clarify expectations and avoid mismatches in playstyle. ([What to do when your D&D players don't care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSHb-nmp_MM))\n\n---\n\n## 9. Prepping for Different Playstyles and Group Needs\nDifferent groups need different prep! For a group of tacticians, prep more maps and tactical challenges. For storytellers, focus on dramatic scenes and character arcs. For casual gamers, keep things light and flexible. Use session zero and regular check-ins to learn what your group enjoys most.\n\n> \"Talk to your players. Talk about what kinds of games they play, about what kinds of books they read or movies they like. Tell them what kind of game you run. You'd be surprised what you might learn. I don't think there's any problem you can't solve by talking about it.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Different Kinds of Players | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQsJSqn71Fw)\n\n**Example:** If your group is mostly \"audience members,\" prep more spectacle and less intricate plot. If you have a power gamer, make sure there's a cool item or challenge for them to shine.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading & Related Topics\n- [Lore Organization and Prep: Surviving and Thriving as a GM](WorldBuilding.LoreOrganizationAndPrepSurvivingAndThrivingAsAGM)\n- [Player Engagement Techniques](GMingFoundations.PlayerEngagementTechniques)\n- [Session Zero Essentials](GMingFoundations.SessionZeroEssentials)\n- [Session Pacing and Table Management](GMingFoundations.SessionPacingAndTableManagement)\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n- Prep for the session, not the saga\n- Review notes and player goals\n- Start with action or intrigue\n- Outline flexible secrets and scenes\n- Keep tools and names handy\n- Take notes for future prep\n- Use feedback to improve\n\n> \"Keep your prep light and focused on frameworks.
