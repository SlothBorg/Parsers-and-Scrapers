        "content": "# Eight Core Combat Types\nMaking every fight feel different starts with **knowing what KIND of combat you are running and why.**  \nMystic Arts distilled the \"infinite\" encounter space down to eight reliable templates.  Treat them as LEGO bricks: pick the piece that serves tonight's scene, then layer in terrain, pacing tricks, and objectives.\n\n---\n## Quick-Select Checklist\nUse this table before you prep a fight or when players go off-road.\n\n| Type           | Core Feeling            | Typical Stakes           | When To Reach For It                        |\n|----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Skirmish       | Classic toe-to-toe brawl| XP, minor danger        | Routine patrols, dungeon rooms               |\n| Ambush         | *We weren't ready!*     | Swingy HP loss, panic   | Wake up the table, punish complacency        |\n| Targeted Strike| *We get the drop*      | High reward, glass-canon risk | PCs plan heist/assassination         |\n| Horde          | Wave of fodder         | Resource drain, time clock | Prelude to harder battle, show scale    |\n| Elite Team     | Rival adventurers      | Tactical chess match    | Showcase villain's lieutenants               |\n| Stomping Ground| Power fantasy          | Morale boost, lore drop | Between tough sessions, establish rep        |\n| Boss Battle    | Climax / life-or-death | Campaign stakes         | End of arc, single-session set piece         |\n| Puzzle Fight   | Brain over blades      | Alternate win condition | Break monotony, highlight environment        |\n\n> Change a few fundamental assumptions and even boring goblins feel fresh.\n>\n> - Dal (Mystic Arts) *D&D Has 8 Types of Combat, Actually*\n\n**How to use this guide**:  \n1. Identify which function your next encounter serves.  \n2. Steal the corresponding design prompts below.  \n3. Cross-check [Making Combat Fast & Fun](Combat.MakingCombatFastNFun) for speed tips and [Six-Ingredient Boss Recipe](Combat.BossBattles.SixIngredientBossRecipe) if you're building a Boss.\n\n---\n## 1. Skirmish - The Default Grind\n*Purpose*: Moderate threat, learn abilities, keep swords warm.  \n*Common Pitfalls*: drags, no stakes.\n\n**Design Beats**\n- Keep **HP totals low** so the fight wraps in 3 rounds (see Fast & Fun doc).  \n- Add a **micro-objective** (secure a prisoner, stop a ritual) to avoid empty slugfest.  \n- Spice with 1-2 terrain features (half-cover wagon, rising water).\n\n*Example*: Three bugbears protecting a treasure winch. Players can flip the lever to end it early but risk dropping the loot.\n\n---\n## 2. Ambush - Enemies Strike First\n> First an arrow hits Silas... then another drops the rogue. *Now there's panic.* - Mystic Arts\n\n**Keys to Success**\n- **Surprise round** + high initiative creatures.  \n- Open with a **narrative hook** (\"Why now?\") not just arrows.  \n- **Wave reinforcement** on initiative 20 to maintain paranoia.  \n- Give players a chance to turn the tables-clever scouting, spells, or retreat.\n\nCross-ref: Ginny Di's tension tricks-use darkness, weather, screams.\n\n---\n## 3. Targeted Strike - PCs Have Surprise\nLet them feel smart for planning.\n\n**Design Prompts**\n- **Over-CR enemy** but grant PCs preparation time (buffs, poison, choke-points).  \n- Start with enemies **unaware**; first round is an alpha strike.  \n- Track **noise / torchlight**-if battle lasts >3 rounds reinforcements appear.  \n- Reward success with intel or loot they couldn't win head-on.\n\n---\n## 4. Horde of Bad Guys - Action-Economy Stress Test\n> 60 goblins is about resource management, not TPK. - Mystic Arts\n\n**Implementation**\n- Use *minion rules* (1 HP, static damage) or group initiative to keep pace.  \n- Present an **alternate solution** (destroy the bridge, break morale) so it's not 8 rounds of mowing.\n- Signal that the **real fight is next**-players must decide which spell slots to burn.\n\n*Speed Tip*: Pre-roll attacks or use static damage (Bob World Builder).\n\n---\n## 5. Elite Team - Mirror Match\nDesign these foes like rival PCs.\n\n**Elements**\n- 3-6 named stat blocks with clear roles (Controller, Sniper, Healer).  \n- Give each 1 signature ability and 1 synergy move (e.g., Warlock's curse boosts Fighter crits).  \n- Foreshadow them through prior scenes; use recognizable silhouettes or callsigns.\n\n**Balancing**\n- Collective CR ≈ party level +2 but built for **action-oriented** variety.  \n- If party focuses fire, allow villains to **dodge as reaction** or pop smoke to reposition.\n\n---\n## 6. Stomping Ground - Let Them Shine\nSometimes heroes should **one-shot** the bandits.\n\n**Guidelines**\n- Telegraph mismatch so players *expect* to win.  \n- Keep encounter &lt;2 rounds; focus on cinematic descriptions (\"The ogre's club shatters under your smite\").  \n- Use to **deliver exposition** via surrendered foes or to reset party confidence after a brutal session.\n\n---\n## 7. Boss Battle - The Finale Flavor\nFull treatment lives in [Six-Ingredient Boss Recipe](Combat.BossBattles.SixIngredientBossRecipe).  Highlights:\n- **Legendary / mythic actions** to offset action economy (Mystic Arts, Ginny Di).  \n- Layer **clock objectives** (seal portals in 6 rounds).  \n- Stage terrain & minions per recipe (Steak, Sides, Sauce...).\n\n---\n## 8. Puzzle Fight - Brains Required\nNot every encounter is won by HP depletion.\n\n**Structure**\n1. **Threat** - monster, trap, clock (trash compactor trope).  \n2. **Hidden solution** - skill use, lever sequence, social option.  \n3. **Pressure** - rising water, damage reflection, minion waves.\n\n**Design Tips**\n- Present the goal **visually**; players must *deduce* how, not *what*.  \n- Make progress trackable (three rune pillars dim as PCs solve them).  \n- Allow limited combat actions so martial PCs stay busy (shove, grapple, guard allies).\n\n> Some fights aren't really fights... roll initiative anyway.\n>\n> - Mystic Arts\n\n---\n## Mixing & Sequencing\nMystic Arts suggests an 8-session arc:\n1. Ambush → 2. Chase to lair (Targeted Strike) → 3. Elite Guard → 4. Horde set-piece → 5-6. Skirmish & Puzzle fillers → 7. Stomping Ground victory lap → 8. Boss Battle.\n\nFeel free to compress or reorder.  Variety + escalating stakes is the goal.\n\n---\n### Designing Tonight's Encounter - Fast Reference\n1. Pick a type above.  Why that type?  \n2. Add 1 terrain feature + 1 objective.  \n3. Check action economy (do they need minions/legendary actions?).  \n4. Consult pacing list: 3-round target, wave schedule, static damage.  \n5. Write one sensory detail that sells the vibe.\n\nRun it.  Adjust on the fly.  Rotate to a new type next session and combat will never feel stale again.",
