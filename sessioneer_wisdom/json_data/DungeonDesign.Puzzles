If you can't check most boxes, consider revising the puzzle or using a different challenge.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Make Puzzles Meaningful\n> \"A puzzle will be most compelling when it makes sense and is meaningfully tied to the larger arc of the game. Ask yourself: who put this puzzle here and why?\"  \n> -Ginny Di, [D&D puzzles that make your players think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqiOaWDMf6g)\n\n- Tie puzzles to the dungeon's history, the villain's motives, or a character's backstory.\n- Avoid \"Galaxy Quest chompers\"-puzzles that exist only as arbitrary obstacles.\n- Example: A door that only opens for airbenders in Avatar: The Last Airbender is both functional and story-relevant.\n\n## 2. Give Players a Clear Starting Point\n- Provide an obvious goal (open the door, reveal the message) and clear interactive elements (levers, keyholes, runes).\n- Offer initial clues: notes, environmental details, or hints from previous adventurers.\n- Avoid puzzles that leave players with no idea where to begin.\n\n## 3. Offer Feedback and Progress Indicators\n- Use sensory cues: grinding sounds, glowing runes, shifting mechanisms.\n- Let players know when they're on the right track, even if the puzzle isn't solved yet.\n- Example: In the Triangle Lock puzzle, each correct key opens a visible clamp; wrong choices trigger negative effects.\n\n## 4. Introduce Risk and Urgency\n- Add stakes: traps, time limits, or threats that escalate if the puzzle isn't solved quickly.\n- Even simple puzzles become exciting if players must act under pressure (e.g., solve riddles before acid fills the room).\n- Use initiative order or real-time timers to keep energy high and prevent endless deliberation.\n\n## 5. Allow Multiple Solutions and Reward Creativity\n> \"Be open minded when it comes to solutions... If your party understands the challenge and chooses to navigate it in a way you didn't expect, you have already succeeded as a DM.\"  \n> -Ginny Di\n\n- Don't be married to a single solution. Let spells, tools, or clever ideas work if they make sense.\n- Example: Picking locks, using Knock, or employing a Chime of Opening as alternatives to the intended solution.\n- Reward out-of-the-box thinking, as long as it fits the established rules and clues.\n\n## 6. Prepare Hints and Avoid Bottlenecks\n- Have a list of hints ready to nudge players if they get stuck (perception checks, environmental changes, NPC help).\n- Use the \"Three-Clue Rule\": for every solution, provide at least three independent clues (see [Best Practices for Running Puzzles](https://www.ttrpg-games.com/blog/checklist-for-designing-object-based-rpg-puzzles/)).\n- Avoid puzzles that halt the session if unsolved-always provide a way forward.\n\n## 7. Make Puzzles Accessible and Fun\n- Not all players love puzzles. Ensure that the challenge is fun for everyone, not just the puzzle-solvers.\n- Allow for teamwork, roleplay, and different approaches (brute force, negotiation, magic, etc.).\n- Test puzzles with different playstyles to balance difficulty and engagement.\n\n---\n\n## Example: The Triangle Lock (from Puzzles, Predicaments and Perplexities)\n- A steel door with 120 keyholes in a triangle shape; two keys with engraved clues are found earlier in the adventure.\n- Each correct key opens a clamp; wrong choices trigger negative effects (e.g., closing walls, traps).\n- Multiple solutions: keys, lockpicking, spells, or creative workarounds.\n- Hints and feedback are built in, and the puzzle is tied to the story by making the keys part of a previous plot thread.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading & Resources\n- Ginny Di's [D&D puzzles that make your players think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqiOaWDMf6g)\n- [Best Practices for Running Puzzles in TTRPGs](https://www.ttrpg-games.com/blog/checklist-for-designing-object-based-rpg-puzzles/)\n- [Classic D&D Puzzles](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-classic-puzzles/)\n- [Immersive Puzzle Design (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERULLQOACKc)\n\n---\n\n**See also:**\n- [Traps](DungeonDesign.Traps)\n\n---\n\n> \"A puzzle doesn't have to be difficult to stand in order to be difficult to complete. Introducing a threat or urgency can turn even a simple puzzle into an exciting encounter.\"  \n> -Ginny Di",
