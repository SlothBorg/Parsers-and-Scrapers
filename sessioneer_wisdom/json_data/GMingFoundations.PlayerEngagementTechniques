        "content": "# Player Engagement Techniques\n\nA practical, multi-perspective guide to keeping players engaged at the table-moment-to-moment and across campaigns. Synthesizes advice from Matthew Colville, Stephanie Plays Games, Bob World Builder, and more.\n\n---\n\n## TLDR Checklist\n- [ ] Tie adventure hooks to player character backstories and goals\n- [ ] Present urgent, personal problems that can't be solved with the character sheet alone\n- [ ] Use \"chase them up a tree\"-force players to react to escalating threats\n- [ ] Start sessions in media res (mid-action) to grab attention\n- [ ] Decentralize information-let clues and secrets be found in multiple ways\n- [ ] Make every player shine: spotlight moments for each character\n- [ ] Accept that not all players will care about lore-focus on fun and agency\n- [ ] Use feedback (e.g., \"stars and wishes\") to adapt to player interests\n\n### How to Use This Checklist\nReview before prepping or running a session. If you notice disengagement, use these steps to reframe your approach and re-engage your group.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Tie Adventure to Player Characters\nPlayers are most engaged when the story is about them. Review character backstories, goals, and previous session notes. Build hooks and challenges that connect directly to what your players care about.\n\n> \"The most exciting thing to your players is them. That's all. Starting my planning with a quick 5-minute review of PCs ensures every session is rich with opportunities for awesome moments.\"  \n> -Stephanie Plays Games, [Prep FAST, Prep FUN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiuOS2XMT9U)\n\n**Example 1:** If a PC is running from the law, introduce guards or bounty hunters. If a character seeks a lost sibling, have rumors or clues surface in the next town.\n\n**Example 2:** In Matt Colville's campaign, a player with a folk hero background was hooked into the main plot by having a more famous folk hero go missing in the adventure location. The player was immediately invested in finding out what happened. (See Colville's [Prepping An Adventure | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXYORWtiLF0))\n\n**Alternative Approach:** Ginny Di recommends letting players co-create parts of the world, such as their hometown or a nemesis, so they have a personal stake in the setting. This can be as simple as asking, \"Who is someone you left behind?\" or \"What rumor did you hear about this place?\" (See Ginny Di's [What to do when your D&D players don't care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSHb-nmp_MM))\n\n---\n\n## 2. Make Problems Urgent and Personal\nPlayers engage when they must react to threats or dilemmas that matter to them. Use the \"chase them up a tree\" technique: escalate problems until the players must act.\n\n> \"The way you make them active is to give them something to react to... chase them up a tree, back them into a corner, give them problems they can't solve with their character sheet.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Engaging Your Players | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iWeZ-i19dk)\n\n**Example 1:** A magical disease threatens the party or their favorite NPC. The only cure is hidden in a part of the world they've ignored-now your lore is the solution.\n\n**Example 2:** In Satine Phoenix's convention games, she keeps the pace moving by changing the environment rapidly-\"the cliff gives way, the water starts to rise\"-forcing even indecisive players to react. (See Satine Phoenix's [Keeping Pace (GM Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxwWuw5lnxs))\n\n**Alternative Approach:** For players who are more passive or \"audience members\" (Colville), don't force them to act, but do present moments where their character is directly affected (e.g., their possessions are stolen, or a personal secret is revealed). This can nudge them into engagement without pressure. (See Colville's [Different Kinds of Players | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQsJSqn71Fw))\n\n---\n\n## 3. Start Sessions with Action or Intrigue\nAvoid slow starts. Begin sessions in the middle of action, a tense conversation, or a dramatic reveal. This grabs attention and sets the tone.\n\n> \"I start nearly every session in media res-jumping straight into the action or something important. Don't waste it with 'you walk into a tavern' unless your players really love that stuff.\"  \n> -Stephanie Plays Games, [Prep FAST, Prep FUN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiuOS2XMT9U)\n\n**Example 1:** Instead of \"You arrive at the dungeon,\" start with \"The stone door slams shut behind you, and you hear the grinding of gears-what do you do?\"\n\n**Example 2:** For a social session, open with \"The mayor slams a fist on the table: 'You have one hour to prove your innocence.'\"\n\n**Alternative Approach:** If your group prefers a slower build, use a vivid, sensory description to highlight interactable elements in the scene (see Mystic Arts' [Make Exploration into a Game to Hook Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4Tu2zzDU3I)). Highlight 2-3 objects or NPCs to draw the players in, then let them choose what to engage with.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Decentralize Information and Clues\nDon't lock key information behind a single path. Prepare 8-10 secrets or clues per session, and let players discover them in any way they choose-through investigation, eavesdropping, or creative play.\n\n> \"Decentralizing your prep means not locking players into specific decisions. Secrets and clues give you the freedom to let players follow their own paths while still guiding them toward the bigger picture.\"  \n> -Stephanie Plays Games, [Prep FAST, Prep FUN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiuOS2XMT9U)\n\n**Example 1:** If the party needs to learn about a villain, they might overhear a rumor, find a letter, or interrogate a captured minion. The clue is available through multiple avenues.\n\n**Example 2:** In a mystery adventure, prepare clues that can be found in different rooms, from different NPCs, or even through failed skill checks (the clue is less clear, but still present). This is the core of the \"Three Clue Rule\"-never rely on a single clue to move the story forward. (See [Mystery Adventures and the Three Clue Rule](Storytelling.NarrativeTechniques.MysteryAdventuresAndTheThreeClueRule))\n\n**Alternative Approach:** For exploration-heavy sessions, highlight interactable objects or locations in your descriptions, and let players choose which to investigate. Each can reveal a different piece of the puzzle. (See Mystic Arts' [Make Exploration into a Game to Hook Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4Tu2zzDU3I))\n\n---\n\n## 5. Spotlight Every Player\nMake sure each player gets a moment to shine-whether in combat, roleplay, or exploration. Rotate spotlight moments and adapt scenes to highlight different skills and personalities.\n\n> \"Share the spotlight with your party. There will be moments and stories where your character will become the focus and you will be hoisted into the center of attention. That's fine, and embrace that. But if it consistently becomes that and you begin pushing the rest of your party out of the way... it can get a little boring.\"  \n> -Matthew Mercer, [RPG Etiquette! (Game Master Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9X2Tz7QegM)\n\n**Example 1:** In combat, design encounters where each character's unique abilities can be useful (e.g., a locked door for the rogue, a magical barrier for the wizard, a social challenge for the bard).\n\n**Example 2:** During exploration, ask quieter players direct questions about what their character notices or does. \"As you cross the bridge, what memory does it bring up for you?\"\n\n**Alternative Approach:** Satine Phoenix recommends using \"rapid rounds\"-move quickly around the table, giving each player a chance to act without lingering too long on any one person. This keeps everyone engaged and prevents dominant players from monopolizing the session. (See [Keeping Pace (GM Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxwWuw5lnxs))\n\n---\n\n## 6. Accept Different Engagement Styles\nNot all players will care about your lore or worldbuilding. Focus on what makes the game fun for them-adventure, problem-solving, or character moments. If players are having fun, you're succeeding.\n\n> \"If your players are having fun, that's already a win. Most players are there for adventure, not lore dumps.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Engaging Your Players | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iWeZ-i19dk)\n\n**Example:** Some players are \"audience members\" (Colville)-they enjoy watching the story unfold and taking their turn in combat, but don't engage deeply with the plot or world. That's okay! Let them enjoy the game in their own way, and don't pressure them to roleplay or take the spotlight if they don't want it. (See Colville's [Different Kinds of Players | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQsJSqn71Fw))\n\n**Alternative Approach:** For players who want more investment, Ginny Di suggests involving them in worldbuilding or asking what kind of story they want to tell together. For those who prefer a lighter touch, keep the focus on action and group fun. (See Ginny Di's [What to do when your D&D players don't care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSHb-nmp_MM))\n\n---\n\n## 7. Use Feedback to Adapt\nAt the end of each session, ask for feedback (e.g., \"stars and wishes\": what did you love, what do you want more of?). Use this to tailor future sessions to your group's interests.\n\n> \"Check in with your players. Maybe the class they chose just isn't as fun as they thought, or there's a cool new magic item they want you to incorporate in the game. Or maybe they just need tonight's session to be lighthearted and fun because they're going through something rough in their personal life. That's okay, but don't leave it up to your players to tell you this stuff. It is your responsibility as the leader of that table to ask them how they're feeling.\"  \n> -Bob World Builder, [How To Keep Your Players' ATTENTION In D&D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbWEJRQX0tU)\n\n**Example:** After a session, ask each player for one thing they enjoyed and one thing they'd like to see more of. Use this feedback to adjust your prep and focus on what your group enjoys most.\n\n**Alternative Approach:** Ginny Di recommends a \"one thing you want, one thing you don't want\" roundtable during session zero or campaign check-ins. This helps clarify expectations and avoid mismatches in playstyle. (See Ginny Di's [What to do when your D&D players don't care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSHb-nmp_MM))\n\n---\n\n## 8. Handling Distraction and Table Pacing\nDistraction (phones, side conversations, indecision) is a common challenge. Set expectations at the start of the campaign (e.g., phone policy, raising hands to speak, no metagaming unless helping a new player). Use pacing tools like timers, music, or rapid rounds to keep things moving.\n\n> \"Let them know ahead of time what you expect from them. This pre-game speech will resolve a lot of pacing issues. Sometimes the players don't know what's okay and what's not okay at the table. So tell them all as a collective what you expect and answer questions up front.\"  \n> -Satine Phoenix, [Keeping Pace (GM Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxwWuw5lnxs)\n\n**Example:** Use a 5-second rule for turns in combat or tense situations. If a player takes too long, gently move to the next person, but always explain this expectation up front and keep it lighthearted.\n\n**Alternative Approach:** For visual or kinesthetic learners, use props, maps, or even physical mini-games (like Satine Phoenix's rubber band combat) to re-engage distracted players. (See [Visual Enhancements (GM Tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI9kHmwc7jk))\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading & Related Topics\n- [Engaging Players: Making Lore and Adventure Compelling](GMingFoundations.EngagingPlayersMakingLoreAndAdventureCompelling)\n- [Session Zero Essentials](GMingFoundations.SessionZeroEssentials): Building party ties and motivations\n- [Session Pacing and Table Management](GMingFoundations.SessionPacingAndTableManagement)\n- [Lore Organization and Prep: Surviving and Thriving as a GM](WorldBuilding.LoreOrganizationAndPrepSurvivingAndThrivingAsAGM)\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n- Make the story about the players\n- Present urgent, personal problems\n- Start sessions with action\n- Decentralize clues and information\n- Spotlight every player\n- Accept different engagement styles\n- Use feedback to improve\n\n> \"If you think of the PCs as action heroes who need to be backed into a corner, chased up a tree, put into dire circumstances, then they will start behaving like heroes and the game becomes a lot more fun for everyone.\"  \n> -Matthew Colville, [Engaging Your Players | Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iWeZ-i19dk)\n",
